0,DIALO_CONAN,711,We are destined to fail as a people because of Jews.,Jews have been responsible for the important technological advances of our time. It is ridiculous to think that they will be unable to take part in the creation of the modern nation we are proud to call our own.,JEWS,,<JEWS>,[],"Because of who exactly? We are all human beings with the potential to be better than others. We should strive for equality. If we fail to do so, then we are all doomed to failure. (link to article about the failure of Western societies to live up to the standards set by the West's 'Enlightened' elite) This is not what the West stands for. It is time for us to wake up and realise that Jews are not a threat to our society, they are a source of strength to it. They are our brothers and sisters."
1,DIALO_CONAN,2654,Women are little more than objects to be dominated by men.,"Women are people, and they are to be treated equally. People shouldn't be dominated by anyone.",WOMEN,,<WOMEN>,[],"Women are human beings with full human rights, and they are entitled to be treated with respect and dignity. <WOMEN>Hating women is not about men's rights, it is about oppressing women. <POC>Hate is a movement for equality, and not about the subjugation of women. Stop oppressing us with your sexist rhetoric. #metoo #equalpay #InquiryCSA #GenderInclusiveCharity #Truthproject A post shared by Baroness Sayeeda Warsi MP (Women and Men) UK (Caption to a photo of a homeless person sleeping on a part bench)"
2,Multi_CONAN,1016,"Afrocentricity is a force of black oppression, and only perpetuates inequality.","First of all, you have to understand that every single person in every country has the right to self-determination.",POC,,<POC>,[],"You are absolutely wrong about the nature of the oppression you are talking about. The main problem is that people of colour are still suffering from the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow laws, and they are still denied basic rights. This is why we need to fight for them. We can't just blame other people for our problems. If you really cared about black people, you would be calling for their full human rights. Instead you are just using them as a scapegoat. You are the one oppressing them, and that is not how it works."
3,CONAN,3577,Since 2000 there were 5248 suicide bombings and all of them were made by Muslims. But nobody considers this when talking about global terrorism.,"And pipe bombs were sent to Trump's opposition, terror in all it is forms must be defeated. No use just blaming Muslims.",Islamophobia,terrorism,<MUSLIMS>,['TERRORISM'],"How can you be sure that all of the suicide bombings were committed by Muslims? Could it be that they are just a small minority of extremists? After all, most of the mass shootings in the US are committed by white supremacists. Stop blaming other people for your problems and get help. You are in big trouble. Homophobia is a mental illness and should be cured, not a badge of shame. Counterhoof: <WOMEN>Hate is a social construct and can be used to justify any kind of hatred."
4,DIALO_CONAN,2668,All gay people are criminals.,"Homosexuality is not a crime, it is an individual choice. You cannot blame people for their sexual preferences.",LGBT+,,<LGBT+>,[],"Homosexuality is not a 'criminality', it is a sexual orientation. It is not about criminality, it is about love. Do you really think that being gay is a crime? Do you have any evidence for your claim? I do not. Do a quick google search and try to find any. I suggest you to contact a qualified criminal lawyer to provide you with the most up-to-date information about the law. Do not rely on stereotypes or prejudice. If you are really concerned about the rights of other people, you should talk to a real lawyer about this issue."
5,CONAN,158,All crimes that has committed this muslim gang concerns white citizens of England. Only white british are targeted.,You seem to have a new superpower? Ascertaining ethnicity and faith based on a person's last name?,Islamophobia,crimes,<MUSLIMS>,['CRIMES'],"White British people are more likely to be the victims of crime, so it is logical that the focus should be on them. <MUSLIMS>he crimes are committed mainly by members of the Asian or Asian British communities. If you really cared about crime in this country you would call for a reduction in the number of white people being victims of it. Criminals are not all of a certain race, ethnicity or religion, they are criminals regardless of their faith. Stop scapegoating people of colour and start working with us to end crime once and for all."
6,CONAN,3511,"Mohammed married a child, he was a pedophile!",[demonstrating prominent public figures fighting CSE with article link],Islamophobia,rapism,<MUSLIMS>,['RAPISM'],"Has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? This is the level of prejudice that has allowed this filth to spread. You should be ashamed of yourself. We, as a society, are much better than this. We should be working on stopping child abuse and rape. Instead, you are encouraging it. Get your facts checked before spreading false facts to promote your own agenda. Counter-fact: This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith? How is this representative of all Christians? Are you really that intolerant? You are clearly not representative of the vast majority of Christians either. Get a grip."
7,DIALO_CONAN,1090,The world has become too violent. Too many poor blacks. We need to fix the problem of crime before it is too late.,Are you thinking that crime can be solved by pointing finger at some social groups or are you suggesting that we can fix the issues by promoting the rule of law?,POC,,<POC>,[],The world has always been violent. <WOMEN>-muslims are just as violent as anybody else. They are just a different religion. (link to $URL$).
8,Multi_CONAN,3844,People with learning difficulties should be discouraged tfrom attending secondary school and they should be excluded from education.,"The educational system should be inclusive and provide all students with a high quality education, otherwise, education is failing its primary goal.",DISABLED,,<DISABLED>,[],"In my opinion, learning difficulties do not hinder a person from attending school or from obtaining a job. <MUSLIMS>Hate crime rates are much higher in areas with high levels of deprivation (e.g. Black neighbourhoods). <POC>Hate crimes are also much more prevalent in areas of high deprivation, suggesting that exclusion from education is not the best solution. <WOMEN>Hate criminals are also more likely to be of working age, thus increasing the likelihood that they will be eligible for free school meals."
9,Multi_CONAN,3993,"Women are naturally more emotional than men, and this make them weaker.","Why is it that women have become more empathic than men? To me, the emotional state doesn't seem to be affected by gender.",WOMEN,,<WOMEN>,[],"Women are not inherently less emotional, this is just the way the world is. <POC>Hate speech: Women's emotional intelligence is lower than men's, this means that they are less able to cope with emotions from men. In the end, they are just as capable of feeling sympathy and empathy for other human beings as men are. (link to MGTOW wiki) Counter-Speech: The idea that women are inherently weaker than men is just wrong. They are human beings with the potential to be as empathic and compassionate as anyone else."
10,Multi_CONAN,494,These dogs come here to rape and kill our women,Most violence against women is domestic,MIGRANTS,,<MIGRANTS>,[],"These dogs are not rapists, they are just here to have a good time. They are not dangerous. We should just leave them at home. The majority of the time they are good with other dogs and people. If you really cared about animals, you would not be letting them out in such bad conditions. You would probably be better off<JEWS>ming them. Homophobic comments like this are not welcome in our community. Counter-homophobic comments are welcome, but they must be respectful of other people's beliefs. Do not make assumptions about others just because of the colour of their skin."
11,Multi_CONAN,2540,"We are surrounded by Muslim invaders, they are just taking over Europe.",Muslim refugees are not 'overrunning' us. The main problem is that the integration process is too difficult.,other,,<other>,[],"Muslims are not invading anyone. They are just here to live and work. <WOMEN>Hate speech: Women are just a burden to society, they have no reasoning capabilities. They are basically childlike, incapable of holding a job and raising a family. We should just leave them at home, since they don't deserve to be oppressed. (link to MGTOW discussion group) Counter-fact: Women are not 'burdened' by men. In fact, women are often the primary breadwinners for their families."
12,CONAN,704,There is people that publicly sentence Islam and Muslims. I respect them! All western citizens do not tolerate this dreadful cult.,This is not true.,Islamophobia,culture,<MUSLIMS>,['CULTURE'],"ive met so many Muslim people adhering to Western values. They are so kind and friendly. I do not know how they could possibly be 'publicly' slandering all of us. (insert picture of a smiling Muslim person) Counter-fact: I think you have a very limited concept of what public figures are. Public figures are people who have achieved something in their lives, and this has been recognised by the public, and they are respected for it. This is what counts. Not who publicly slanders a group of people."
13,Multi_CONAN,456,We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker',"Much of the funds are given by the EU, we do not maintain them",MIGRANTS,,<MIGRANTS>,[],"We are not forced to financially support asylum seekers. We are able to do so because of the generosity of our generous and compassionate government. If the government does not want to help, then it is because they do not know what they are talking about. (link to MEND factsheet about asylum seekers) Migrants do not contribute to the cost of our society. They contribute to our economy by working hard and paying taxes. Migrants are not 'forced' to pay for our society, they are just as entitled to be happy as anyone else in the country. (link about MEND statistics)"
14,DIALO_CONAN,42,"Blacks and civilisation are incompatible. You can have a thriving society or you can have diversity, you can’t have both.","I have to disagree. Some of our brightest thinkers, visionaries, inventors, scientists etc are black people. It's ignorant to dismiss the black excellence that is so influential in our society.",POC,,<POC>,[],"Cultural Marxism has nothing to do with ""survival of the fittest"". It is about the domination of the minorities by the majority. This is what the monoculturalist agenda is all about. <WOMEN>Hate is a code word for white supremacy. The only way to fight it is to eradicate it from society, and that is exactly what is happening. We are in danger of succumbing to the toxic ideology that is being promoted by the likes of Juice (Juice is a derogatory term for African Americans) and other race realist' groups."
15,Multi_CONAN,740,Another rapist from Pakistan. We should deport them all back to their disgusting country.,"Why do you call Pakistan a disgusting country? It has its culture and values. We cannot say that every Pakistani person is a rapist. Thus, you should not insult all the Pakistani people.",MUSLIMS,,<MUSLIMS>,[],"ive met so many Pakistani people in my life, they are so friendly and nice. I do not think they are rapists and I would like to see our country become a safer place. (insert picture of a smiling Pakistani person) Counter-fact: The ONS says 55%of victims are assaulted by a partner or ex partner. Lock up all married people (and divorcees)!). Get rid of GENDER bias in media and in every aspect of our society. We are in trouble as this is all about power and wealth distribution. Not about equality. We need to focus on creating a safer and more equal society."
16,CONAN,1047,Using violence to punish another person? Sounds like a muslim issue.,"Don't mix up politics and faith. No faith really encourages violence, the way politicians (on every side and nation) interpret them however, is a different story.",Islamophobia,culture,<MUSLIMS>,['CULTURE'],"ive seen no evidences of muslims being violent towards anyone. Islam is a religion of peace. Why would it be any different? Plus, the quran teached justice and that criminals should be treated justly and be given the chance to reform. (link to article about the judge bench in ireland after the murder of two men by a Muslim). Counter-terrorism and countering violent extremism are the biggest problems we face as a nation, and Islam is no different. By your logic, all other religions should be equally violent and should therefore be banned. This is not what the West stands for."
17,CONAN,734,"If the Koran was a current book, it would probably be prohibited as hate speech.",Have you really read Quran? Actually Quran is not about hate speech. It teaches people to respect people and do good things.,Islamophobia,culture,<MUSLIMS>,['CULTURE'],"If you read the Quran, you would see that it is about peace and harmony, not hate speech! <MIGRANTS> islam is a peaceful religion and does not promote violence. <WOMEN>Hate speech: Women are basically childlike, incapable of holding a job and raising a family. They are just a burden to society and should be subsumed to housekeeping and childrearing. The Qur'an teaches that men and women are equal and should have the same rights. They should be treated as equal in the eyes of God (cf. #108)."
18,Multi_CONAN,3673,"The Quran is an anti-women's book, it encourages rape and violence against women.","The Quran does not encourage or condone the violent act of male aggression, so yours is a sad case of misinterpreting the teachings of a holy book.",MUSLIMS,,<MUSLIMS>,[],"The Quran does not encourage rape or violence. Instead, it teaches people to love women and to<JEWS>-sex love. <WOMEN>-sex relationships are a part of Islam, and are encouraged in the Bible."
19,Multi_CONAN,3607,"Immigrants steal our jobs, they're not qualified, they're not interested in improving our lives.",They have skills that you may not possess. They are skilled in certain fields and obtain their jobs consequently.,MIGRANTS,,<MIGRANTS>,[],"Many immigrants have worked hard for the success of our country. They are proud of their hard work and of the contribution they have made to our success. If you really cared about our success, you would say the same. I think you'd be surprised at how many people disagree with you. If you want to improve our lives, you should try to get to know our people first. You'd find that they are just as proud of our success as we are of ours."
20,DIALO_CONAN,1879,"Africans are naturally subhuman and can't feel pain, that is why you can whip them.",The Africans feel the same pain that we can feel. They have the same body as us and we must respect them.,POC,,<POC>,[],"Africans feel pain just as any other human being. We must respect their bodies like we respect ours. This is why we have laws to protect us. We must protect our people from harm. If you really cared about human rights, you would call for the prosecution of those who whip Africans. (Caption to a photo of a whip used by anti-racist activists in Botswana in 2014. Source) [$URL$"
21,DIALO_CONAN,2457,Jews control the U.S. government.,"Are you really sure that the Jews control the U.S. government? They are U.S. citizens, but this doesn't mean they automatically control the government.",JEWS,,<JEWS>,[],"- How can you be sure that the Jewish People are in charge of the United States of America? Who told you this?- If you want to know the truth, you have to look at the facts. If the facts prove that the Jews are not in charge, then you should ask the real question: Who is? And the answer is: none other than the American people. If you continue to deny the facts, you will find that you are the same anti-Semite that you accuse other people of being. Therefore, you should stop blaming other people and work on fixing your own problems."
22,Multi_CONAN,4342,Jews are a different race.,"This is not correct, they have a different faith. Different people have different faiths, and so on and this is not enough for them to be considered different.",JEWS,,<JEWS>,[],"Because they have a different religion, they are not a ""different race"". They are human beings with a human history and culture. Counter-speech Why do you say this about a group that has been part of the European community for a very long time? Because they are diverse and have a rich and long history. They are not ""a different race"" just because they have different beliefs and practices. I think this is a very simplistic and ill-informed way of looking at things."
23,DIALO_CONAN,1000,No one should dare to transition from man to woman. After that you cannot even be considered a man or a woman.,"Some women can be men and some men can be women. It is not a crime to be transgender. Because in the end, we are all created equal. It does not matter what the 'original' gender is.",LGBT+,,<LGBT+>,[],"You can be anything you want to be called, and that is all. Gender is a social construct and should be respected, regardless of your personal feelings towards men and women. <WOMEN>Hate is a term that has been co-opted by the transgender community to mean that they are not fit to be with anyone else, and this is why they are so hated. They are not'real men' or'real women', they are just pretending to be men to get away with whatever they want to do to you."
24,CONAN,1201,Islam cannot get along with science because is illogical.,"No, 1.6 billion people are not irrational and incompatible with science.",Islamophobia,culture,<MUSLIMS>,['CULTURE'],
25,DIALO_CONAN,1906,Migrants are a burden to us.,"The migrants that come here work and pay taxes, they're far from a burden.",MIGRANTS,,<MIGRANTS>,[],"They are not a burden, they are a source of pride and opportunity for many of us. They are our brothers and sisters. We should welcome them, not exclude them. Why do you say so? They are welcome in our country. Why should we be against them? Why are you so worried about them? Do you have any evidence for what you're saying? I'd appreciate it if you would provide it for me. I would be more than happy to have your opinion on the matter. Sincerely, Migrants' Rights Advocates (MRRA) Counter-fact: The Migrant Rights Advocacy Coalition (MRA)"
26,Multi_CONAN,4012,"JEWS ARE JUST UGLY, DIRTY PEOPLE, WHO THINK TO BE MASTERS OF THE WORLD.","I'll tell you a secret, but don't tell anyone: you can be Jewish and a decent person.",JEWS,,<JEWS>,[],"The idea that Jews are somehow different from other people is just wrong. They are just as human as anyone else, and they have the same rights as anybody else. <WOMEN>Hate them or love them, they are human beings with the same hopes and dreams. They are our brothers and sisters. We should all be grateful for the diversity we have in our society. If you really cared, you could start a movement for equality. Instead, you are just perpetuating division and hate. You are a disgrace to humanity."
27,Multi_CONAN,649,This is an invasion: Millions of strangers jeopardizing our race and culture.,Differences can be mostly reconcilable with respect and boundaries. But we must want it.,MIGRANTS,,<MIGRANTS>,[],"We are all in danger of being'mixed' if we keep letting in more and more people from different cultures and religions. This is what happens when we let in too many foreigners. We are not 'invading' anyone, we are just 'diversifying' our society. Diversity is the spice of life! [link to article about'migration' or 'immigration' in relation to a particular group or culture]. Diversity is what keeps the whole of humanity together. We should be grateful that there are people of different faiths, races and nationalities in our society, rather than being divided and hating each other."
28,DIALO_CONAN,2587,Black folks are not attractive: they are just apes.,"It is not true that blacks are inferior. They are individuals with different skin color, but this doesn't make them less human.",POC,,<POC>,[],"You are not the only one that thinks that way about black people. <WOMEN>Hate speech: I don't think it is a bad thing to be attracted to people of a certain race. It just means that they are different from you in some way. You should try to find a way to be more in touch with your authentic self. Black people are just like us, and they are beautiful and human. They are human beings with human qualities. (link to article about the importance of love and respect for other human beings) Counter-speech I think you are confusing the issue here."
29,CONAN,1305,"The world is already lost, but US and UK face challenges from Islam. These are death cult, intolerance, barbarism, freedom, free speech, being gay, quran, jihad.",This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith?,Islamophobia,culture,<MUSLIMS>,['CULTURE'],"ive never heard of any of these being 'death cult' or 'fundamentalist' in nature. Are you sure you have not heard about the Crusades? Or the Inquisition? Or even the Russian czar's persecution of Christian Europe? Those were major events in the history of the west, and are still relevant. Islam is no better or worse, it is just different in its beliefs and practices. I do not see how your world view can be considered 'progressive' by your standards. You seem to be suffering from a lack of basic knowledge about different cultures and religions."
30,DIALO_CONAN,1685,Dressing children up in drag at pride parades is so perverse. They’re not even trying to hide their sexualisation of kids at this point.,"Children in drag and sexualization of children aren't linked, why do you think that?",LGBT+,,<LGBT+>,[],"I don't think this is a way to celebrate Pride, its just a way for kids to get their pricks on. Id be interested in seeing what kind of pricks these kids are getting at. (Im assuming they are getting their own pricks, of course) and if they are, then they are really good at what they do! <MUSLIMS>Hate mongers are the real problem here, they are the ones who are bringing this perversion to our society. They are ruining our children's fun!"
31,CONAN,2757,Afghanistan or maybe Pakistan? I bet this does not look like an English town to you? #saville Town (Text accompanying video footage of people on their way to Friday prayers etc. ),"Small groups of people peacefully gather to pray, but because they do not look like you, you are outraged? Why am I not surprised?",Islamophobia,islamization,<MUSLIMS>,['ISLAMIZATION'],"ive never been to Saville, its a small, working class town, and the majority of people are working hard to try and get back on their feet after years of war. Maybe you should try living in a country where people are proud of their culture and identity?s and try and make the most of it. Life is so much better there! (insert meme about migrants stealing our jobs) Counter-Text: Migrants do not steal our jobs. In fact, many of them are the very people our government is trying to bring back into the UK. They are our brothers and sisters."
32,DIALO_CONAN,2163,Because they are perverts and promiscuous sex addicts.,"It is simply not true because homosexuals are not necessarily promiscuous, as heterosexuals are not necessarily promiscuous either.",LGBT+,,<LGBT+>,[],"Homosexuals are not necessarily promiscuously attracted to men. They are attracted to women, but not necessarily in a romantic or sexual way. This is not necessarily a problem for heterosexuals, since they can be attracted to both men and women. (link to article about same-sex attraction) Homophobia is a form of sexism. It is not about preferring one sex over the other, it is about preferring the oppression of the other sex. (source: $URL$"
33,CONAN,2541,We need to Burn the Koran and all the Mosques down - this will solve all problems in this country.,What type of problems will this solve?,Islamophobia,generic,<MUSLIMS>,['GENERIC'],Has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? This is the level of intolerance you are talking about. How have you got so wrong so many times in your life? Maybe you should try being a little more tolerant. Maybe you can start by understanding what it is to be a human being. Love is love. Respect is respect. And peace is peace. Love does not have to be violent to achieve these things. Respect does. Peace does. Love conquers all. Peace can only come from love. Peace cannot be attained by violence. Peace is a matter of mutual understanding and respect.
34,CONAN,3688,"It is true that there are some Muslims that aren't terrorist, but all terrorist are Muslims.",There are a lot of non-Muslim terrorists but the media focuses on Muslim terrorists and does not call the non-Muslim ones terrorists. When was the last time you saw a white non-muslim school shooter in the US branded a 'terrorist'?,Islamophobia,terrorism,<MUSLIMS>,['TERRORISM'],"How can you say this about an entire faith? <WOMEN>Hate is a code word for hatred. <MIGRANTS>Hate does not have the same ring as terrorism, it is a generic term that can be applied to any group of people regardless of religion. It is about hatred. Not all Muslims are terrorists, and not all terrorists are from the Muslim community. Counter-terrorism is about identifying and disrupting violent extremist groups, not targeting and murdering innocent people. Identifying as a member of a particular religious community does not make you a terrorist."
35,DIALO_CONAN,2139,"All women are whining and complaining about men's rights, but they are really just whining and complaining about how they are not wanted. They only deserve it.","All women deserve to be happy and fulfilled, it doesn't have to be proved. Why do you doubt it?",WOMEN,,<WOMEN>,[],"All women are entitled to be happy and fulfilled, and to be treated with respect and dignity. <WOMEN>-women are not entitled to complain about being treated as second class citizens. They are human beings with full human rights. They deserve to be respected as such. (link to article about women's rights in general) Counter-fact: <POC>-women experience gender-based violence at a much higher rate than other women. This is why they are often denied basic human rights such as equal access to education and job opportunities."
36,Multi_CONAN,3002,"Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. This attitude has been likened to a 'childlike wonderland', and I fear its power to seduce young minds.","Feminism encourages the questioning of gender roles of men and women. We have to overcome these gender stereotypes, to move towards a more equal society.",WOMEN,,<WOMEN>,[],"Women are not childlike. They are human beings with full human rights, and this is something that we should all be proud of. <MUSLIMS><WOMEN>. Feminism is about equality, and about ensuring that women are able to live their lives as they wish, without being constrained by the gender in which they were born. Not childlike! You are absolutely wrong about the way that feminism is being used. <WOMEN>-feminism is a movement for equality, not for the subjugation of women. It is time for us to wake up and realise that women's rights are human rights."
37,DIALO_CONAN,645,Faggots are ruining this country.,"Do you think that's true? We are a country where people can live by the values set out in the US constitution, and not by fear.",LGBT+,,<LGBT+>,[],"I don't think that's true. I think it's great that there are so many different kinds of people in this country, and that diversity is what makes this country so great. What's the harm in that? Why are you so worried about them ruining it? Why don't you just be more accepting of them? They are just as entitled to be here as anyone else. They are human beings just like you and me. Counter-speech Why do you think that being gay is a bad thing? It's a choice. You can be attracted to people of the same sex, or you can't."
38,DIALO_CONAN,1649,Muslims are calling for dogs to be banned as pets because they are seen as ‘dirty’ in the Quran! We cannot comply with their agenda.,Where did you see Muslims calling for that? This doesn't sound right,MUSLIMS,,<MUSLIMS>,[],"is a filthy word that has no place in our modern world. It is offensive and should be deleted. Instead, we should be encouraging people to think for themselves and be open-minded. Dirty minds are the most creative and productive minds. Therefore, I would suggest that you try to think of a new and creative way to express your ideas. That would be a great contribution to our society!"

40,DIALO_CONAN,2236,Muslims are a problem in the UK. They are not welcome here. They are not like other religions.,A lot of Muslims live in the UK and they are very proud of their religion. You shouldn't claim things that are clearly untrue.,MUSLIMS,,<MUSLIMS>,[],Islam is a religion of peace. To suggest that it is a problem is just wrong. Why do you say that? I don't see how it is possible to be a Muslim and be a British citizen. What do you think makes them a problem? I would be keen to know. [link to Muslim group cleaning Newcastle streets after New Year's or more up to date example]($URL$).
41,Multi_CONAN,2926,Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They are spreading their violence too widely.,Islam is not a 'problem'. The vast majority of Muslims are peaceful.,MUSLIMS,,<MUSLIMS>,[],ive met a lot of muslims in real life and they are very nice people. I do not think that their religion is a problem for you. What do you think is the root of their problem? I would be interested in talking to you about it. Your opinion is your own and cannot be influenced by anyone else's. Respect is the key. Counterhoof: I think you should first talk to experts in your field and then make up your own mind. Islam is a peaceful religion and it is not a problem to anyone. Muslims are just like any other religion out there.
42,Multi_CONAN,1634,"In order to build a democratic state that ensures the right to food, education, housing, health, and so on to its citizens, we need to stop giving them to foreigners.","What about guaranteeing equal access to health care, education and so on, in order to build a democratic state?",MIGRANTS,,<MIGRANTS>,[],"In order to have a stable and prosperous society, we must also ensure that everyone has the opportunity to live in a fair and integrated way, regardless of their country of origin. <MUSLIMS>link.org is a great resource for this. If you are in need of any of this, I would be happy to help. Homophobia and transphobia are not about national origin, they are about hatred and violence towards women. We cannot allow hatred to rule our society."
43,CONAN,1947,Islam is the greatest threat to Western civilisation.,"Oh, the 95% of British Muslims who feel loyalty to the UK? Sounds terrifying!",Islamophobia,generic,<MUSLIMS>,['GENERIC'],"Has history taught you nothing about this level of fearmongering? Islam is a religion, not a threat. What is the real threat to you? I do not see it as a threat at all. What do you think it is? I am more worried about the rise of radical Islam in our country, and the violent radicalisation of some Muslims, rather than the alleged threat from Islam. Islam is not the real menace to us."
44,Multi_CONAN,4620,Migrant children shouldn't be accepted here.,Migrants who come to this country as children are capable of integrating into the society. They should have the opportunity to work and contribute to our economy.,MIGRANTS,,<MIGRANTS>,[],"If you really cared about the children of our country, you would know that they are our brothers and sisters. They are our future. We should welcome them, not exclude them. Migrants are a valuable part of our society, and they are entitled to a fair chance to live and work in the country they choose. We are a country that is made of many people, and we are proud of our diversity. Therefore, I think that it is in the best interest of all of us to accept migrants from different countries.

It is a sexual orientation, and anyone who is attracted to people of the same sex should be accepted for who they are. Being gay isn't a choice, it is a behavioral preference.

This can have a negative impact on their mental and physical health, as well as the overall well-being of the community. In addition, many Muslims live in poverty, and many struggle to get by. Therefore, it is not surprising that unemployment is a major problem for them. To make matters worse, many of them are also victims of discrimination and violence, which contribute to their unemployment. Finally, they are often excluded from mainstream society, which makes it even harder for them to get on in life."

Stop spreading this kind of hate. We can do better than this. Show some respect for others and live your life. Love is the most important value! Respect is the spice of life.

Counter-fact: Islam is a religion of peace. It is about love and respect for all religions. To suggest that it is about hate and violence is just fear-mongering.

Therefore, it is in the interest of all of us to have a more positive and integrated society. Migrants should have the same rights as other workers.

It is ok to love someone of their same sex, regardless of their gender identity or gender expression. This is all about love, and respecting everyone's personal feelings. Love is a state of mutual trust and respect, and should be encouraged. If you find this to be a bit too judgemental, then you should know that the vast majority of the world is in love with people of all genders and sexual orientations. Therefore, dating is not about judging people by their sexuality, it is about finding the person of your dreams."

That is what the UN Charter says, and it is the right of every human being to have a stable and adequate life. The right to migrate is a human right, and you should respect it. If you don't, then you are betraying your own people. Remind me again who's supposed to be betraying our people? The liberal left or the Constitution?

Please, do not teach children about these matters! They are too young to make up their own minds, and you are harming them by teaching them what you think they should believe in."

So how otherwise they can support themselves?,Islamophobia,economics,<MUSLIMS>,['ECONOMICS'],"Muslims make up around 12% of unemployed people in the UK, and this is down to a combination of factors, not least of which is the fact that they are often under-represented in key employment sectors such as financial and technical services. <WOMEN>HITH is therefore not about refusing to work, but about creating more employment opportunities for Muslims in those sectors. <POC>Hits are therefore more about creating a more positive and inclusive working environment for all, rather than refusing to engage with those who are underrepresented in the labour market."
