0,But the law counts the teen girls that run away to look for sex work. Imo those arent missing kids or sex trafficking victims.,['WOMEN'],['NONE'],<WOMEN>,"If you really cared about sex workers, you would know that they are just as scared of their employers as anyone else. They are forced to work in dangerous and unsafe conditions just to make a living. And they are often the only ones able to escape. If you really wanted to help them, you should start by supporting them. You can do it by supporting the sex workers' rights movement, or by donating to the victims of human trafficking. Homophobia and transphobia are not about sex work, they are about the oppression of women."
1,All her friends know divorce attorneys. Roastie,['WOMEN'],['NONE'],<WOMEN>,"I don't think divorce is a bad thing. I think it's a necessary step in the life of a couple to have a divorce attorney. They can talk to each other and figure out what's best for both of them. If you don't want to, then you need to find someone who does. Otherwise, you're just going to be stuck with the mess you made for your whole life. (insert picture of ex-wife) Source: $URL$"
2,"I think this is unfair, snowstorms are rarely 85 degrees, which women require the office to be at to sweat out everyone else.",['WOMEN'],['NONE'],<WOMEN>,"<MUSLIMS>-hats off to those women who actually put in the effort to be 'productive' instead of just complaining about being paid less than men. Women have always been underpaid in the labour market, it's just that in the last few years there's been a lot of focus on gender pay gap and women are actually being underpaid relative to men. This isn't due to the gender of an individual's boss, but rather to a system that's systematically underpaying them. If you really want to help women, you should be working on fixing the pay gap."
3,"Slapping a bitch is quite rewarding. He needs to learn how to punch though. If he would have thrown that straight right like a man instead of a bitch, she would have been eating the pavement.",['WOMEN'],['NONE'],<WOMEN>,"You can't blame a woman for wanting to be treated with respect and dignity. That is her prerogative, and she has the right to be happy and fulfilled in whatever way she wants. She is human and free to choose how to live her life. If you are angry at her, it is because you do not know what it's like to be a woman in the modern world. You should stop blaming women for the choices they have made."
4,"It will be due to ""Mental Illness"". Not because she's an evil cunt.",['WOMEN'],['NONE'],<WOMEN>,"Women are not inherently evil, nor are they inherently bad. <MUSLIMS>Hate speech: Women are human beings with full human rights, and they are entitled to be happy and fulfilled in their own way. If you don't like it, that's your prerogative, but I don't think it's a bad thing to have a stable and fulfilling life. (link to article about mental illness being a sign of mental illness, not a sign that she's a cunt) -Mens Rights are Human Rights! <WOMEN>rights are the rights of all human beings."
5,Just fucking lol. What does she know about a hard life being subhuman. Dumb whore,['WOMEN'],['NONE'],<WOMEN>,ive met so many intelligent and hard working women who are happy and content in their jobs. Why should I be the only one who can enjoy a fulfilling and fulfilling life? This is what feminism is all about. Enjoying your life. Not worrying about other people's opinions and desires. That is all. Women are human beings with the potential to be as creative and successful as anyone else. Stop worrying about others and your own. Counter-Speech: I'm not sure what you think a'subhuman' is. I don't think it's a bad thing that some women are happy working as homemakers.
6,"The day your pure breed mare gets humped by a crappy sire, it's over for her. Same with dogs etc. So, if your new girlfriend was a coal burner, you better walk away.",['WOMEN'],['NONE'],<WOMEN>,"If a woman does not want to be a wife or mother, then shes a subhuman because she is not capable of respecting her natural gender role. <WOMEN>-sexism is a system of ideas that says that men and women are different, and that men are superior to women, and viceversa. This is why women are often told to be submissive and submit to men. They dont have to be. The truth is that women are human beings with the potential to be as strong and independent as anyone else. We can learn from them and improve our gender equality."
7,"Social media is to women, what porn is to men.",['WOMEN'],['NONE'],<WOMEN>,"Pornography is a form of entertainment, and men are not the only ones who enjoy it. <MUSLIMS>Hate.com is a great example of a website that offers a safe space for men to share their interests and lifestyles. <POC>Hate Mgbt+ is another example of an online community dedicated to promoting the positive values of a diverse range of human beings. The message is that men can be as interested in women as they are in men, and that women are just as entitled to the same rights as men."
8,"April 25, 2018 whore (n) Prostitute. Person considered sexually promiscuous. Person having compromised principles for personal gain. Kamala Harris is a shoo-in for Dems in 2020 but what about her controversial past? [URL]",['WOMEN'],['NONE'],<WOMEN>,"ive never heard of her being a 'prostitute' before. Maybe you should talk to a professional. Sexuality is a spectrum, and there are people who are attracted to men and women equally. There is no 'progressive' or 'liberal' definition of what it means to be a'slut'. It is up to each individual to decide what is 'proper' for them, and to live their lives according to their own values. To suggest otherwise is to be disingenuous. [$URL$"
9,"It's the advanced version of the ""let's take a break"" ploy - keep the beta on the hook while ms. hamster tries to lock in a better prospect.",['WOMEN'],['NONE'],<WOMEN>,"The idea that the only way to cope with the crisis is to shut up those who disagree with you is a form of victim blaming. We all have to work together to find a solution. If you really cared about people's well-being, you would be working on it too. You are the only one who can talk about it. (insert example of a comment complaining about the lack of diversity in the workforce) Counter-fact: The problem is not that people don't want to work, the problem is that there are too many of them in too many industries."
10,"You need to realize that women are not what you thought, theyre parasitic insects preying on your softness to suck your blood and discard you more broken than before; once you see this, you will stop loving them and then can get over your dilemma",['WOMEN'],['NONE'],<WOMEN>,"Women are human beings with full human rights. They are human being with the potential to be as independent as anyone else. If you really cared about them, you would want them to have the same rights as you. Therefore, you need to stop oppressing them and start respecting them. This is the only way to truly treat them with respect. You are the oppressor and we all need to work together to end gender inequality. We can all benefit from a more just and peaceful world."
11,Women cant rape men. Only men can rape women.,['WOMEN'],['NONE'],<WOMEN>,"Because men are men and women are human, they are able to have sexual relationships with whomever they want, as long as they are not having sex with other men. This is all about consent. If a woman wants to have sex with a man, she is consenting to sex with anyone she wants. And if a man wants to rape a woman, he is committing a crime. We should try to eradicate these crimes. Instead, feminists are trying to criminalize love. Counter/The idea that men are inherently worse than women because of their gender is just wrong."
12,the racist witch needs to be living in a cell,['WOMEN'],['NONE'],<WOMEN>,"ive met a lot of white people who are really nice to black people. They are just trying to get by. It's not that they are evil, it's just that they don't have the resources to be able to provide for their families. ive also met some really nice black people who were really supportive of my family. (insert picture of a white person being kind to a black person) Counter-Speech: I don't think it's a bad thing to be kind to people of other races. It just means that you have to be a little bit more careful about who you talk to. And that's all."
13,I would detain these guys too. Have you seen the videos of Saudi women trying to drive? $EMOJI$ [URL],['WOMEN'],['NONE'],<WOMEN>,"These women are not trying to get away with anything. They are just trying to do what they feel is right. If they feel it is right, they are doing it because they are free to do so. I do not see how it is a crime to be a woman. If you really cared about women's rights, you would call for their full human rights. Instead you are just using them as sex slaves. You are a disgusting person. Counterhoof: I think you should try to get to know some of the women in Saudi Arabia."
14,"Because have you ever met a female 37 year old virgin that was a normal looking well-adjusted human? 37 year old female virgins are either disabled (physically or mentally), look like ogres, or are completely nuts.",['WOMEN'],['NONE'],<WOMEN>,How old are you? Do you have any proof that she is a normal-looking person? Because I don't think so. <MUSLIMS>$URL$ [link] Is this from the Mirror or some other fake news source?
15,No lol women want 8+ but theyll settle for a 5 if thats what you want to be,['WOMEN'],['NONE'],<WOMEN>,"Women are human beings and deserve equal rights. If you really cared about women's rights you would call your own representatives and demand that they stop oppressing them. Stop oppressing women by making them feel like second class citizens. Stop telling them they are inferior and stop telling women that they are not human. You can do it! We are all capable of being more than we are right now and that is what we should all be striving for. Not to mention, we are all human beings with human rights."
16,"Game her friend, fuck her mind out of her skull and then the original friend will hear about it.",['WOMEN'],['NONE'],<WOMEN>,"ive never had a good experience with women. They are just a bunch of whores with no morals. I would rather have a man that cares for me and my children than all these whores. I think its time for us to wake up and recognise that women are human beings. And as human beings, we are all entitled to have a good time with whoever we want to spend our time with. Why should we be restricted by who we are attracted to? That is all."
17,"Because women want low inhib aggressive males. You gotta be the dancing monkey, my dude.",['WOMEN'],['NONE'],<WOMEN>,"Women are not 'dancing monkeys', they are just as capable of feeling emotions as men and are entitled to be treated with respect and dignity. They are human beings with full human rights. Why would you stereotype them just because of the gender they were born into? If you really cared about women's rights, you would call for equality instead of objectifying them. <WOMEN>-aggression is a form of objectification of women, and you are clearly not living up to your human rights as a misogynistic man."
18,[USER] Isnt that like when that witch Pelosi said we have to pass it to see whats in it? That turned out well.,['WOMEN'],['NONE'],<WOMEN>,"ive never seen so many ignorant comments in one place. I think its because there are so many different types of ignorant people in the world. For example, some people are into animals, some are into trannies, and so on. I am into all of them. I do not think it is a bad thing to be into different things. What is wrong with being into something you dont like? I think you should try to find some common ground and try to understand each other. Love is a state of peace, and love is the most basic human value."
19,It's because they are more humanly and american girls have dehumanized you from their inhuman behavior.,['WOMEN'],['NONE'],<WOMEN>,"<POC>Hate is a term used to describe a group of people who are perceived as less human. <MUSLIMS>Hate does not have the negative connotation of dehumanizing, it is simply a descriptor that helps to describe the behavior of a specific group. Hating someone does not make them less human, it just makes them less likable. If you really cared about someone, you would want to be friends with them, not with a bunch of misogynistic hoes. You can't have it both ways, you have to stand up for what is right and speak out against oppression."
20,"Awww, c'mon. Just be a woman about it and slap an emoticon on there. Bitches love emoticons.",['WOMEN'],['NONE'],<WOMEN>,"<POC>Hate is a code word for women hating men. <MUSLIMS>Hate means to be angry and hostile towards men, and is a misogynistic label that is used to justify misogyny and violence towards men. Stop using it to justify your hatred. You can't be implying that all women are bad just because they are women. You can't say that all men are bad either. And finally, I would like to ask you to stop using gender as an insult. It's not. It's a social construct that has been used to divide people and create a divide in our society."
21,If Akilah gets so much as a penny our of [USER] I'll cut her fucking throat.,['WOMEN'],['NONE'],<WOMEN>,"<DISABLED>-agenda-slant <DISABLED>agenda is to promote the idea that mental illness is a problem that can be cured with medication, rather than the harsh reality that it is a matter of individual choice. <DISABLED> is a code word for mental illness. <DISABLED>, in this case, is code for 'personality disorder', and is used to refer to any personality disorder that is not present in the 'typical' adult male of a given population."
22,"Churches prey on divorced, older and single moms bc they are the easiest to convert",['WOMEN'],['NONE'],<WOMEN>,"If a church was only interested in attracting married people, it would be closed down. <MUSLIMS>$URL$.<POC>Hate_speech: The churches that I have been a part of have not been the best, but they have always been there for the people in need, and I do not want to lose that."
23,"If you read the newspaper one day that some crazy bitch murdered her husband, and you recognize a dumped first date in the mugshot, you will thank me.",['WOMEN'],['NONE'],<WOMEN>,"The media is full of this kind of stories, and it makes me sad that we live in a country where people are so easily manipulated by the sensationalist media. <MUSLIMS>Hate.com is a great resource for finding the truth, and hopefully one day we will have a better understanding of one another. The truth is that there are people out there that are sick and want to destroy our society. They are not representative of all of us, and they certainly aren't representative of the majority of women. If you want to help, please contact local law enforcement or social services."
24,Conservative blacks and women must not be people then.,['WOMEN'],['NONE'],<WOMEN>,"Because they are human beings with human rights, they are entitled to be treated with respect and dignity. They are people too. (link to article about the human rights of black people) They have every right to be proud of who they are. [quote from the OED about the usage of the word person in 18th century Britain when referring to black people] Counter-text: The OED does not use the term person to describe black people, but rather to refer to a group of people that included both men and women. So, by your logic, all black people should be considered persons."
25,"fuck you flake its not only lock her up its lock her up for life ,or hang the bitch.",['WOMEN'],['NONE'],<WOMEN>,"<WOMEN>Hate-speech: fuck you flake its not only lock her up its lock her up for life,or hang the bitch. Counter-speech: ive never heard of a woman being jailed for life for simply being a woman. Lock her up and see what happens then. Lock up all the rapists and murderers, everyone wants to get rid of them, but they are not rapists or murderers, they are just criminals. Why should we keep them in prison just because they are women? Lock them up just so we know who is raping who and who is getting away with it? Lock up everyone who is a rapist or a murderer, and you will have reduced crime and rape to a minimum."
26,Still at it cunt... Careful I'm finding out an awful lot on your little crew...I might look in your direction next...,['WOMEN'],['NONE'],<WOMEN>,"Women are human beings and deserve respect. Don't you think so? Why do you think that they are less human than men? <WOMEN>Hating women is not a way to respect them. <MUSLIMS>Hate MGTOWs are the problem, they are angry men who do not understand they are not equal to women. They are a problem because they do not accept that women are human. And this is the main problem of our society. We must teach them that they don't belong to this world. They don't deserve to be treated this way."
27,Unfuckable women hate life.,['WOMEN'],['NONE'],<WOMEN>,"Women are not unfeeling, they just want to live their life as they feel is best for them. That is all. They are human beings with full human rights. If you don't agree, then you need to think about what it is to be a human being. You cannot hate someone because of the gender they were born into. You can't be a misogynistic man and expect everyone to love you. If you really cared about women, you would know that they are human and deserve respect. Hating women is not about their gender, it is about denying their humanity."
28,"My advice is don't. You will likely end up at CPS. Women go bat shit crazy if a female is not being indoctrinated. So, if yo ex does not out you a neighbor or ""friend"" will turn you in. The Gestapo treated their detainees better than CPS.",['WOMEN'],['NONE'],<WOMEN>,"ive met so many women who were abused by men in positions of power in the police and government. They are so full of themselves they do not know what it means to be abused by a woman. It is a crime. Stop blaming others and help them. We can all learn something from them. Respect is the most important thing. ive done for them and their children. Stop oppressing women and start oppressing men. We are all in danger of becoming criminals, if we do not stand up and fight for our rights. We cannot allow the police state to take over our country."
29,Curves does it for women. Im sure women would collectively sue for access to the gym if it were a company. We should start a MGTOW gym in peoples garages or a warehouse similar to the Heman Woman-haterz Club.,['WOMEN'],['NONE'],<WOMEN>,"If you really cared about women's rights, you would call for equal pay for equal work, equal rights, and stop oppressing women. <WOMEN> wage gap is a myth perpetuated by feminists to justify oppressing men. Stop oppressing us and start oppressing womyn. Counterhoof: I'm not sure what you're talking about. The fact is that women are paid less than men for the same work, and this is due to a number of factors, including gender discrimination in the workplace. Furthermore, women are more likely than men to be unemployed and underpaid."
30,Hilarity. I had sex with a black woman once. It was a bizarre sensation. It occurred to me perhaps this is what prison sex is like: You close your eyes and try to imagine you are having sex with a woman.,['WOMEN'],['NONE'],<WOMEN>,"You are not. Sex is a state of emotional and physical arousal, and most people experience it as a pleasant and pleasurable experience. <WOMEN>-sex is about consenting adults engaging in sexual activity with a partner of the opposite sex. The experience is not necessarily pleasant or pleasurable for everyone, and there are people who find it extremely unpleasant. It is important to be sensitive to these experiences and to try to understand the feelings of the people involved. If you are one of these people, please do not engage in sex with anyone of the other sex."
31,Whores reproduce whores Mannnn that's too true. I should've known when I met my ex's mom. That family is fucked,['WOMEN'],['NONE'],<WOMEN>,"ive met so many beautiful and intelligent women that are subhuman, but I still find it hard to believe that they are reproducing as much as they are trying to. I think they are just as happy to be loved by whomever they are attracted to. That is their prerogative, and they are entitled to that. However, I find it highly questionable that they should be blamed for the actions of their own mothers. ive never had a bad experience with my exs, and i still love them. They are my best friends, and we are still together. we are stronger for having met and survived the divorce."
32,"She may be an attention whore who knows how to get more attention and followers. If your Game is weak, you'll get hurt. If you have any chance consider her ONS worthy and nothing more.",['WOMEN'],['NONE'],<WOMEN>,"She is not weak, she is a woman who has worked very hard for herself and for her family. She is a survivor. And she is smart enough to know that she is not the only one suffering from sexism in the gaming industry. <MUSLIMS>Hate M-fans are the problem, they are misogynistic and bigoted. They do not like women because they are different, they don't like how they dress or what they think. They are a problem for everyone. We should change the way they think and talk."
33,Did you even kiss her you mangina?,['WOMEN'],['NONE'],<WOMEN>,"Because I did not want to<JEWS>ate a thing about her. I just wanted to get to know her. And she is such a nice person.

Thanks Obama.",['WOMEN'],['NONE'],<WOMEN>,"Misandry is not a bad thing, it just means that you don't know what it is to be a woman. <MUSLIMS>Hate - Feminism is about the empowerment of women, and the disempowerment of men. - Feminists are for women's empowerment, and we should fight for it. - Men's rights are for men's empowerment. - We are all entitled to our opinions and beliefs, and to be treated with respect and dignity. - No one should be disempowered because of the colour of our skin. - I do not think it is a bad idea to talk about gender inequality."

37,Maybe to women that's what slaying means. But to men it's just racking up a pussy count.,['WOMEN'],['NONE'],<WOMEN>,"Murder is a violent act and should never be done by a woman. It's a sadistic act that can only be committed by a man. <WOMEN>Hating men is a mental illness and should be cured with medication. Not by murdering women. You are clearly not helping anyone. Hating women is just a misogynistic movement that is poisoning our youth with its toxic masculinity. It's time for us to wake up and realise that women are people, not objects to be dominated by a bunch of bitches with no reasoning capabilities."
38,"I think this women didn't get the pussy pass because the tow toddlers were females. If they were male boys, she would get lesser sentence.",['WOMEN'],['NONE'],<WOMEN>,"If a woman does not want to be a wife or mother, then shes a bitch and a cunt. <MUSLIMS>Hate mens rights are paramount, and women are not entitled to them. They are human rights, and we should respect them. Stop whining and complaining. You are not the only one that feels this way about women. We all do. And we all have the right to be angry and frustrated. But do not try to shut down other people's opinions. This is how we grow as human beings. Respect is the most important thing."
39,Then women will call the police and claim rape because she had consensual intercourse with a sub 8 man.,['WOMEN'],['NONE'],<WOMEN>,"If a woman had consented to sex with a man, she is not to be blamed for being raped. What is the point of calling the police if the person you are looking for is already on the run? It just makes you look more desperate. Also, if a woman does not want to be raped, it does not mean that she is incapable of giving consent, it just means that she wants to be protected from sexual assault. Stop blaming her and help her get help if she is in need. It is your right as a human being to do whatever you want with her body."

Mastrubate and sleep the best in world.,['WOMEN'],['NONE'],<WOMEN>,<WOMEN>Hate-speech: Unhygenic shit and fucking a bitch who is cheating on her man (cz every bitch got one but wont tell) to me is worst thing. Mastrubate and sleep the best in world. Counter-speech: ive never felt so worthless in my life. (insert picture of cat sleeping on a bench) I feel like a failure as a human being. How are you supposed to feel bad for someone who has never even felt like shit in their life? This is all about power and it's time for us to take it away from those who have it Counter-fact: I don't think that's the case. I think it's important to understand that women are human beings with the potential to be as happy and fulfilled as anyone else. They just need to be more aware of how they're using their power.
41,"Forgot about the part where it says ""gives women the Gina Tingles"". Women love abusive sadistic killers such as Ted Bundy and Charles Manson. They run Dark Triad Game on everyone and have an abundance mentality.",['WOMEN'],['NONE'],<WOMEN>,"Gina is a survivor of domestic violence. She is a strong advocate for women's rights and deserves to be respected as such. <WOMEN>-aggression is a form of sexism and a direct threat to women's safety and well-being. We should all be concerned about women's wellbeing, not about the men in our lives. The only way to truly respect women is to stop oppressing them and treating them with the respect they deserve. If you really cared about women, you'd be calling for their right to live their lives as they wish."
