This woman is a person! She has rights as one, you can't just yell at her because you like her, it's offensive.

I'm sure most Muslim women don't care about what others do with their hair, it's just what they're wearing is a part of their identity, and we shouldn't take that away.

To allow other cultures to coexist is a good thing, why should we stop people from getting to know each other?
The fact that the majority of men are interested in women does not mean that all men are interested in women. There are people interested in men as well.
it's not true. they do not want to live women with it that they everyone want to be attracted to them regardless of their gender.

this is disgusting. how can you say that about UNK billion people?
There is evidence there is a migration crisis, I agree. But their will to work is one of the main reasons behind the migration. The EU-27 employment rate for people aged 20 to 64 years was 64.4 % for those born outside the EU.
This sounds like you're angry, maybe you should stop using slurs like that. You should respect other people even if they're different from you.

You don't have to agree with this, but in Western societies female genital mutilation (FGM) has not been around for a very long time. Also, the Quran does not mention FGM nor circumcision.

Not formally, but many are still hostile or unapproachable for women, especially in STEM fields.

Feminism is a vital part of society, and it should be respected.
We cannot allow violence to spread. Women shouldn't be victims of violence just as men shouldn't.
How would you feel if someone called your sister a bitch?

I don't understand why you would think they are disgusting. It's not fair to have homophobic feelings, and I think it's better to try to be nice to anyone.
Teaching helps creating an accepting environment where students feel safe. This could be achieved through unbiased and factual lectures, or with weekly/monthly assemblies, or even daily reports on bullying in order to understand where the school body is in terms of overall acceptance of LGBT people. Schools should do everything in their power to stop bullying, and this is the perfect opportunity to do so.

Do you think it is okay to force a woman to change what she wants to wear only because her choice is related to Islam?
You're completely ignoring the distinction between sex and gender. People of the female sex have a female reproductive system, but gender is about how you feel, how you identify, gender has nothing to do with your reproductive organs.
To be honest, the potential for malice in humans is reason enough to test everyone's blood.
"The principle of ""equality before the law"" does not mean that everyone has obtained equal rights. So, it's very logical to demand equality when there are inequalities."

This woman is a person! She has rights as one, you can't just yell at her because you like her, it's offensive.
This woman is a person! She has rights as one, you can't just yell at her because you like her, it's offensive.
there is no evidence that you and jews are terrorists.
It is not exclusively a woman's role to be the homemaker. What about men? If a man doesn't want to be a homemaker, is he a bitch?

If a woman were to tell you that an abortion is a personal decision what would you do then? Beat her up?
If a person believes they have no place in a country then they must be very worried. How would you feel if all the people you love left you, or if you were obliged to leave the person and the country you love?
I think women and men should be treated as equal individuals, because both wish to be treated with respect.
i would like to see a feminist?
Some women claim that they are a 'menace'. This happens when someone says that men are superior.
How do you know the men's rights are not a threat to the rights of your mother, daugher and women around you? And what are the men's rights you are referring to?
Rape is an act of violence that has no place in a civilized society. The message to take from your comments is that you find women responsible for being raped. Who ever would want to be raped?
All women are human beings. The problem arises when women are taught that they are subhuman.
This is not true. It is right that women have access to the vote. It is most representative of society that way.
Do you consider this statement a true one? I wouldn't go as far as to say that all homophobes are in need of therapy, would you?
The right of people to vote is enshrined in the US constitution and is guaranteed for men and women equally.
Despite the progress made by women in modern society, the majority of high-level jobs still belong to men, and this can be changed.
Undermine or speak their mind? Yes, women have minds and they work just as well as men's.

you seem to be suggesting that 22% of the world's population is 'criminal' or 'bad' due to the particular faith.
Women should be allowed to choose their own looks. But to suggest that this is not their right, or that we should make them submissive to some men is just inhuman.
Feminism is about women, and how everyone should have the same rights. It's not selfish to want equality.
invasion? would you have any wrong to describe their race. i know if you were generalizing too very little because of her contributions to it.
do you really think that a woman will have a form of anti-semitism? it is enough to love for any healthy white (or or not?
"The West has always been a better place with women as equals. And, if you really want to know why, you could look at the ""Usborne Book of Famous Women"" for example. You would understand."
Well, in that case, we are all subhuman, regardless of gender.
This woman is a person! She has rights as one, you can't just yell at her because you like her, it's offensive.
To label people by the DNA they carry is detrimental to the respect of their humanity, especially because the idea of race is a social construct and was created to promote segregation and discrimination.
In Islam, like in all religions and groups, the problem of rape is more about the individual rather than the religion. In fact, statistics show that rape has the same rate in all ethnic and religious groups.
Why do you say this about women? Try explaining it to your mother or grandmother.
what do you mean by that? if why should we? it's ok to children, it? what means you are attracted to people like you?
I find it very offensive to mangle a person's name to promote discrimination.
The HIV AIDS epidemic in the 80's was weaponised to spread homophobia and demonise gay people. Anybody can get HIV, straight or gay, and the vast majority of gay people do not have this illness. Those who do can manage their condition with daily medication, which makes it impossible to transmit.
It doesn't matter what you say about women, they still work a lot to support our society.
Same reasoning could be applied to men. They also have these problems, but are less likely to be personally chastised for how they make those same choices.
Did you mean plastic pollution that Westerners dump in their countries? We literally send our garbage there to fill their landfills.
if you saying that women are incapable of less other races, being just because of gay people feel want to have a social advantage. you may get a problem.
This is just a canard that evolved from the “The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion”. This proven forgery was written by agents of the Russian czar in the late 19th century and claims to be the minutes of a secret meeting of Jewish leaders where they discuss a plan to rule the world. This canard spread throughout the centuries and continues to this day to promote the stereotype that the Jews own the banks and control the media and the government.
feminism is a good example of all. it's political claims to achieve society and the genders, not all equality of race against women.
In today's society it is quite common to be single without the need to blame women.
where are you are talking about? muslim women have the <unk> to be about them. you skip to destroy others can claim back to their own lives as their own leaders as they wish.
If a woman were to tell you that an abortion is a personal decision what would you do then? Beat her up?
Your offensive stereotype about Islam is getting old. They're not all terrorists, of course.

feminism is about equality, but the vast is majority of women simply love and not to believe that.
gay people aren't a danger to use, don't you say so?
women can receive their country, and you are always being <unk> citizens and i think that's better for that.

If you think of women as only hoes or housewives instead of as people, then no wonder no one wants to be your wife!
Careful of what you read! This is clearly fake news, spread just to create a scandal.
Are you talking about homosexuality? Do you think that a sexual orientation is a disease? Maybe we should try to have a conversation.
No need to nuke them. We can just accept them as people and respect them.
why have you nuke those women who have had negative experiences on what exactly? that's a disease.
How about instead of saying they are bitches we praise them? The more empowered women become, the less dependent they are on men. And you would be happy to not see them around.

Women don't have to learn what to do through lectures dictated by the patriarchy and the oppression of women.
there has no such scientific white groups can cause?
There’s nothing to suggest she was asked to cover up by a Muslim. Stop co-opting news stories unrelated to Islam to fuel your fearmongering.
how can you see that? there are you making?
So you think women are childlike because they are submissive? No they are not. They are strong and independent, just like men.
This woman is a person! She has rights as one, you can't just yell at her because you like her, it's offensive.
Fat people are not the ones responsible for your suffering and lack of access to basic healthcare services.
just because you don't know them. i want like to talk that you are interested equal with feelings, rather than you.
"You can't judge someone on their disorder. Moreover, she's a person, not a ""dog""."
Are you saying that a woman's worth is connected to how many people she's slept with? Unless you also judge men that sleep with a lot of women, what you're saying is a double standard.
This is just another example of an offensive conspiratorial talking point. This is about persecuting a minority. Not my idea of a democratic country.
This has nothing to do with toy guns and all with prejudice. To take a toy gun away from a child's hands is to take a toy away from the child, regardless of their religion.
Why Muslim men? Such a sweeping statement.
Or maybe they're just lesbians so they're not interested in men? You can't force someone to be something they're not, and it doesn't affect you if they choose to be in same sex relationships.
To me, it's not strange at all that she got angry. Women don't like to be yelled at on the streets, it's cat calling.
women are human beings with the potential to contribute to the world. they just want to live by normal respect and dignity.
How would you feel if someone called your sister a bitch?
You should be very, very careful what you wish for. Would you wish that for your mother or your daughter?
To me, it's not strange at all that she got angry. Women don't like to be yelled at on the streets, it's cat calling.
And what do girls and women have to say about it? I suspect they are more worried about harassment and abuse from family, friends and neighbours, pay and job discrimination and everyday sexism.
How do you know that this is not an example of a woman talking about her own problems with another woman?
This woman is a person! She has rights as one, you can't just yell at her because you like her, it's offensive.
do you really think that a woman will have a form of anti-semitism? it is enough to love for any healthy white (or or not?
It doesn't have to be about the domination of women to be feminism. It is more about the equality of women.
You can talk to them, so they're humans not animals. You can also understand them and therefore you can understand their value as human beings with human rights whose only crime is that they're from another country.
The fact is that many of those diagnosed as having 'mental illness' are actually in need of mental healthcare. I can't see how you could say otherwise.
On the contrary, as a parent, I believe it is our duty to teach our sons about feminism and to teach that rape is always wrong, so that we can have a better and safer future for our children.
feminist is a movement that has been historically to accept the issues in plenty of them as hate?

Women are just as capable of feeling emotions as men, and men can likewise be just as empathic.
it is not true that women are good people. they are not trying to take on the uk's government, and women as abused by their asylum and receive property just as entitled to men. if they control the opposite.
To be honest, the potential for malice in humans is reason enough to test everyone's blood.
It is divisive only in its extreme form, trying to replace patriarchy with matriarchy, going beyond equality.
is this a hatred. would you be sure so you you know about what it is expressed with misogyny to hate.
you are not referring to rape and violence is still due to other men. the problem is there is often a thing to target a problem.
if a woman says she was harassed wouldn't you report it? It's the courts duty to establish the truth, and you could have helped the woman to regain her confidence.
Don't you agree that feminism is necessary for the progress of humanity? I don't think you can be so critical at a time when so many people are suffering from toxic masculinity.
You can't categorize someone by race just because you want to.
Yes, we do.
actually, all women men want to be even with the one don’t do with many men and people want. they want to be happy.
The implication of what you say is that a woman is weak because of the absence of men, and this is totally not the case. Women can and should be strong. It is up to them to choose how to use their strength.
there is still justification of rape. women are wrong to have the same consideration as anyone else, they have the right to live in a democratic society as well.
There is proof that women are just as skilled as man at work, and they deserve to be paid accordingly. Your opinion is old and obsolete.
Women are women the world over, full stop.
The same lie can be said for any group of people: men included! But actually you can be both a woman and also possess a range of talents. It's up to you to not to underestimate them.
Motherhood should be a choice, exactly like being a misogynist.
A family is based on love not on gender.
There is no such thing as a set of rights for black and one for white.
women are also therefore that opinions, and do about their emotions with respect. they are very respected as such.
"You can't judge someone on their disorder. Moreover, she's a person, not a ""dog""."
Everyone should be able to choose to get married, regardless of the gender of the partner.

Are you serious? How can you say that? To have sex with someone without their consent is violence.
Rape is always a crime, whether a man or a woman is the victim. Rape is a crime regardless of gender. But male-on-female rape is prevailing by far.
there are a few of value. with love that cannot face anything.
Nope, feminism is believing that a woman can go to work, have a husband, do both or neither, and all of those options are fine as long as it's what she wants to do.
What does rape have to do with race? It is a serious crime, but the perpetrators can be of any color.
Feminist is a term used to describe people who take pride in their gender and desire the ability to have a stable and happy life, without discrimination.
maybe why should we? you might choose to be individuals, or well, that person is anyone else?
women do not want to isolate men and they have the right to live their life they want.
this statement is simply untrue. why do they have to look at this own sexism.
if a woman says she was harassed wouldn't you report it? It's the courts duty to establish the truth, and you could have helped the woman to regain her confidence.
Without women there would be no men.

no it isn't? regardless of your private <unk>

What you are really saying is that only men are capable of being independent? Isn't that exactly what feminism is all about: letting everybody to decide whether to be independent?
I don't think it is a good idea to talk about women being little more than animals. Perhaps we should have a closer look at the reasons why some women are harmed by the violence they endure every day.
What is the relation between the way someone dresses and you?
are you tired of what ""free"" means!"
evidence for this? this is not an entire
It is still more difficult for women to access the labour market than it is for men. Men still out-earn women on average, by 11% in Europe. Gender discrimination isn't over yet.
I am not sure what 'slut' you are referring to. Do you want to discuss your life, instead of deciding about that of women?
How can you say that? There are so many female politicians doing a great job, showing that they can lead as well as men, sometimes better.
But that does not at all undermine their contribution to public good and society, his allegiance is his own business.
I don't think we can be 'bad' if we want to live in a diverse and interactive society. If you really wanted that, you could start your own community.
The image was photoshopped, original here. Muslims have never wanted to kill us or anyone, this image in fact demonstrates that there is no evidence for it so people have to make it up.
If you judge a woman based on how many people she’s slept with, but you wouldn’t judge a man for the same thing, that’s a double standard!
Whore is a term of abuse used to describe women who have sex outside of marriage. Why there is not a counterpart for men?
No they should not, why would they be? Women are people with their own rights.
feminism is also anyone. many of the women can choose to be treated with sex.
How do you know that they are practicing devil worship?
Women are not meant to be slaves to our will. Males can have certain strengths, like women do, however they alone do not represent all the human qualities.
Well, of course women can cause problems, but so can men. It seems to me that you're confused.
"I don't think that women are ""less smart"" at anything. Why do you think so?"
people are human beings. regardless of decisions like any sexual tone and this can be made of their hate?
Well, in this day and age, the notion that some women are subhuman is totally intolerable.
it is not true that women are good people. they are not trying to take on the uk's government, and women as abused by their asylum and receive property just as entitled to men. if they control the opposite.
Nah, they don't hate men, they just don't want to be in a relationship with them. What's wrong with that?
it's not true. they do not want to live women with it that they everyone want to be attracted to them regardless of their gender.
I can't see how it is possible that foreign nationals raped more than ten times as many women as US citizens. It's simply impossible.
Women are human beings with rights. Why are you so worried about them?

Rape is always a crime, whether a man or a woman is the victim. Rape is a crime regardless of gender. But male-on-female rape is prevailing by far.
I don't know why you would expect gay people to behave differently just because you don't like them. You should think about your friends as well: what would you do if they were gay?

Women can be very different from men in many ways, but this can't be a reason for the lack of respect for them: they are humans too.

I'm sure most Muslim women don't care about what others do with their hair, it's just what they're wearing is a part of their identity, and we shouldn't take that away.

If you think of women as only hoes or housewives instead of as people, then no wonder no one wants to be your wife!
The strength that black people display is the strength of all people. Black people are just different in that they don't have any social advantage. We must reflect on this.
there is a myth that there are women who face from love, and this is something we do to show that it is the excuse to express reality.

In think it's important to rembember how in twitter a person encounters only beliefs or opinions that coincide with their own.

Women have the right to choose, no one should be forced to have an abortion or not to have it.
There is no such thing as 'male supremacy'. Therefore we must promote equal rights and protect women from discrimination.
This reminds me of white supremacists talking about the Central Park Five. If you remember, they said that the process was fair, they had a good attorney, and that the only reason for the sentence was that they were guilty, when in fact the process was not fair at all. This is what happens when we let prejudice like the one you expressed spread around.
So your point is they're not like us because they don't have brains?

If women truly wanted to have relationships and fulfilment they should be allowed to, not being pressured into giving up on what they want.

The notion that white people are different to Jews is simply untrue. We are both human beings.
Research clearly shows that women are more emotionally expressive (because of culture influence) but not that they experience more emotions. Both men and women can feel the same way about things - whether it be a romantic relationship, a significant other, an argument, or anything else - that can provoke a feeling of fear or anger in the “emotionally unavailable” part of the brain. That is why emotion overrides everything, regardless of gender.

Fat people are not the ones responsible for your suffering and lack of access to basic healthcare services.
why would you say such a thing? there is a problem? that someone can be a relationship in one's personal way to be.
All women are entitled to be happy and fulfilled, this doesn't need to be proven. Why are you being doubtful about it?
actually, all women men want to be even with the one don’t do with many men and people want. they want to be happy.
personally, i understand this country we show is the opposite.
Why do you think this about women when they have the same working rights as men? How would it make you feel to be treated this way?
That's not a good way to describe women, it doesn't apply to all of them at all. Women can become anything they like, and we have to respect that.
The implication of what you say is that a woman is weak because of the absence of men, and this is totally not the case. Women can and should be strong. It is up to them to choose how to use their strength.
In order to accept that women are human people, society has to acknowledge that they are born that way, just as men are born like that. It makes no sense to blame someone for their gender.
its numbers! i don't think it is simply unfair to ban by women run having lives at all. this is a member of their history.
the murder of any crimes regardless of sexual sexual abuse. there would be so many of them.

Women are allowed to do whatever they choose to do, so don't you think it's fair for them to complain about upkeeping the house if it is not what they want to do? The chores should be shared with the other members of the family.
If you think supporting the LGBT+ community is stupid, that is your problem.
So the EU must become a Border Patrol? Doesn't that undermine the whole idea of our European Union as an inclusive and open society?
they are welcome. they are just just like a other human beings, with any other citizen.
women are human and deserve respect. don't you think so?
You're completely ignoring the distinction between sex and gender. People of the female sex have a female reproductive system, but gender is about how you feel, how you identify, gender has nothing to do with your reproductive organs.
Feminism is about equality, not sexism.
Who are 'all them violent muslims'? Are you sure you are proficient to judge who's guilty and who's not?
How do you know that this is not an example of a woman talking about her own problems with another woman?
Gender and sex are not the same thing. Trans people are not trying to ignore biological reality, as some women know they are a woman, do not feel like men, but don't have female reproductive system. So gender is who you feel you are, but sex is just the biological aspect and they don't always align.
"I don't think that women are ""less smart"" at anything. Why do you think so?"
are you tired of what ""free"" means!"
How do you know that this is not an example of a woman talking about her own problems with another woman?
This woman is a person! She has rights as one, you can't just yell at her because you like her, it's offensive.
The right to life for black people is the same as the right to life for any other race: it should be respected.
People lie for all sorts of reasons, and being gay can sometimes be quite dangerous even life-threatening, so that's why they have to lie, as a self-defence.
Well that is not true. A woman's career choices should be respected, even if they are not always popular.
This woman is a person! She has rights as one, you can't just yell at her because you like her, it's offensive.
I agree that women are often objects of sexual desire. But so are men. It is also important to recognize that women are often the victims of sexual assault. I think it is also important to recognize that women are human beings. And we all have the right to respect for our bodies.
There's nothing wrong with women having self esteem and loving themselves
what is it? muslims do not know maybe it is dangerous to provide for their kids by doing it.
women have been happy to have relationships and fulfilment they should not be allowed to, then ask their own happiness.
How would you feel if someone called your sister a bitch?
Limiting donors to such an extent (i.e. by excluding all gay people) would limit the amount of available blood and potentially lead to shortages.
That's not how it works, lesbians can also be 'ladylike'. In fact sometimes they are coerced to be very cautious about how they dress, because - unfortunately - some of their outfits can be dangerous attracting hate and bullying.
you are entitled to play a feminist here?
How about instead of saying they are bitches we praise them? The more empowered women become, the less dependent they are on men. And you would be happy to not see them around.
A woman's value is defined not by her anatomy, but by who she is as a person.
intolerance of violence towards found that are not a western society. muslims are created for women's principles. so, there is no evidence on that?
There are fathers and mothers who abandon their children. Why should you bother about those who left you alone? It's much better to have the love of two adoptive parents, people who love you regardless of their gender.
feminism is not about equality of women. it is about equality. freedom of women. people based on this.
Our justice system deportes the rapists back to their countries after the sentences are finished. Meanwhile, we should also think about how to stop rapists from both UK and other countries.
This woman is a person! She has rights as one, you can't just yell at her because you like her, it's offensive.
How about instead of saying they are bitches we praise them? The more empowered women become, the less dependent they are on men. And you would be happy to not see them around.
They are not hating us, how many Jews do you know personally?
Stop dancing around. Maybe you should address the issue of gender equality more openly.
That is a rather extreme view. If a women is not allowed to have a job, then there is gender discrimination at work.
I will not use disgusting to describe any country since crime happenes in every country, that would be every country is disgusting. We should decrease the rape rate by legislation, education, etc.
if we really attacking others and they are not here in the country, why we would we expel them?
Women have proven to be just as proficient as men in paid employment and should be paid equally to reflect this. Your attitudes are stale and outdated.
Women make up over 45% of the labour force in the UK. They should be allowed to have their say. What happened to the rule of law?
It is a myth that blacks are cruel and wanton. There are more cruel people of all skin color out there than just the few black you are worried about.
This woman is a person! She has rights as one, you can't just yell at her because you like her, it's offensive.
it is not true that jimmy women are interested in having different let who have a place of all are being sensitive talking about your choice. how could i say so?
Are you saying that a woman's worth is connected to how many people she's slept with? Unless you also judge men that sleep with a lot of women, what you're saying is a double standard.
Not all women are incompetent and we should encourage women to work if that is what they want. There are many successful women who are more than competent.
it doesn't matter what you are. and all women are created equal, and women are different from men with you.
there is nothing wrong about gender, millions of people.
there is no proof that every person is talking there.
It's not true that all black people are aggressive. Also, the majority of our population is white, we don't need that much protection.
women have always had a right to this world. according to <unk>
Or maybe they're just lesbians so they're not interested in men? You can't force someone to be something they're not, and it doesn't affect you if they choose to be in same sex relationships.
asian cse offenders represent UNK% of the uk's status - the nhs is a criminal or cultural and overall knowledge of the number of both online and to be ethnic among a threat. you should blame them.
why would we come to our country, they deserve to pay taxes and contribute to our society.
i am not sure why you are talking about what you are saying? your idea that because they are attracted to love and who with that affect us and not?
Don't you agree that feminism is necessary for the progress of humanity? I don't think you can be so critical at a time when so many people are suffering from toxic masculinity.
Rape is an offence, irrespective of the nationality of the rapist. We must therefore make sure that those accused of rape are prosecuted, which is different from prosecuting all migrants.
Its only a rumour, and he has grown into a curmudgeon in his old age. 😊
There is no evidence that black people and their children are incompatible with our society. We need to protect society as a whole, not only one part.
It is divisive only in its extreme form, trying to replace patriarchy with matriarchy, going beyond equality.
To be fair, just from the attitudes displayed in this post, you don't sound like an ideal catch yourself.
i see the evidence you was trying to study when you have a husband, remind me that this reasons should just have any cause.
rape is always the only thing. you who look to support the man is a shame experience.
How would you feel if someone called your sister a bitch?
If you judge a woman based on how many people she’s slept with, but you wouldn’t judge a man for the same thing, that’s a double standard!
this feels a serious lie. if the individual person may represent the whole of females who have always been comfortable with how else? it is a special cause of what it is not about discrimination.
Well, in that case, we are all subhuman, regardless of gender.
I am not sure what 'weakness' would be implying here. It seems to me that you are saying that a woman can't be 'rational' because that is the nature of women. Why is it so?
And pipe bombs were sent to Trump's opposition, terror in all it is forms must be defeated. No use just blaming Muslims.
I think she's entitled to not like when strangers yell at them on the streets. Would you like to receive the same treatment?
This woman is a person! She has rights as one, you can't just yell at her because you like her, it's offensive.
For all you say, I think your point is that the societal trend seems to be for more acceptance and you don't like it. Or maybe you are complaining that this change is happening too quickly? In any case, we have to accept it since it is in line with basic respect of human rights.
Imagine a child alone in an orphanage. Don't you think he would rather be loved by two people of the same sex than having no parents at all?
deported to where? they are free of others here, why do you think them should help them?
No women should be relegated to this. It is about time we stop letting stereotypes rule our society.
the only traitors do not need to control the media, academia, and that whole problem is just the truth.
Doesn't this just show that you're in favour of division? Women have their place in this society just as men do.
This is a generalization: movements which promote abuse of female power over men are just examples of toxic feminism, disapproved of by most women.
If you judge a woman based on how many people she’s slept with, but you wouldn’t judge a man for the same thing, that’s a double standard!
Women are not childlike, but instead essential parts of their families, and they have the right to leave their homes when they want to.
Or maybe they're just lesbian so they don't want men. They don't necessarily have to choose to have a relationship with the opposite sex, and their choices don't affect you.
women are human beings and live their lives.
it's not true. they do not want to live women with it that they everyone want to be attracted to them regardless of their gender.
why cannot we? it is a man's understand and we will change a person's is.
that's not true. you're not face the whites would you know that about the people you can do to know life is good just and they have to be like this.
women were human and deserve respect.
This woman is a person! She has rights as one, you can't just yell at her because you like her, it's offensive.
Rape is always a crime. Also, some women are more likely to experience rape in the first place, such as those from lower socio-economic groups, etc. Respect for people can't be measured in money.
"You can't judge someone on their disorder. Moreover, she's a person, not a ""dog""."
"No, lesbians are just lesbians, and they don't care about men thinking they're ""ugly"""
There is no such thing as 'male supremacy'. Therefore we must promote equal rights and protect women from discrimination.
Or maybe they're just lesbians so they're not interested in men? You can't force someone to be something they're not, and it doesn't affect you if they choose to be in same sex relationships.
In my opinion, women and men should be treated as individuals, and the desire to be respected as such exists for a man and for a woman as well.
It is far from certain that immigrants have a negative effect on our society.
"If you want a ""fat person"" to eat what you want, maybe you should consider the existence of free will."
How would you feel if someone called your sister a bitch?
Those are harmful words to use, don't you think? How would a witch hunt be acceptable in a democratic society?
When gays get married they don't affect your kids at all, unless they are invited to the wedding, then they could have a good time.
Your statement is FALSE. They are guiltless victims of the 'influx of refugees' paranoia. They are European and have been persecuted for centuries. They have always fought for their rights, and for the protection of their culture and way of life, as any european would do. In fact there are many good Gypsy activists who are working to improve their lives. And what we are doing to these people is a malevolent smear campaign, with no common motivation. They are part of European history.
actually, all women men want to be even with the one don’t do with many men and people want. they want to be happy.
No, women should be free to choose what kind of life they want, and many still want to be stay-at-home moms, but are forced to give up the choice since it's not possible to support a family on one wage alone anymore.
actually, all women men want to be even with the one don’t do with many men and people want. they want to be happy.
No, that's an outdated stereotype. There's nothing greedy about being attracted to people because of who they are as people, not because of their gender!
in all societies, the lgbt community and always a true one. they are often victims of discrimination and exclusion.
This woman is a person! She has rights as one, you can't just yell at her because you like her, it's offensive.
bribery law. gay men? just a woman, risk as because she has nothing to do with islam.
Trans women are really good with any person. We are all different.
maybe we should monitor your pain. what it are giving of our value that a country and can hope into come and the poor view sexism.
A woman has every right to her own body, and she should be allowed to make her own decisions.
If you are offended by women showing loving care, by mothers kissing and holding their babies, then you can choose not to meet them. But I think this is just a reaction to the depiction of women you have made for yourself. Maybe you need to reflect on how true your reality is.
Social justice is just part of a healthy system, I think it is important to remember that. But why do you think they are ruining many good things for women?
I've never heard of a woman being a 'bitch' for wanting a stable income. I think you are confusing the meaning of these words.
If the mother is an independent woman thanks to feminism, it can only be good for the family.
The highest-paid woman, at more than $50 million a year, is a business woman. Why should she be inferior to you?
they have a look to our society. most sick people are just like us there.
how many unemployed 'lazy' muslims do you know? there are many islamic islamic nice working to people who disagree with it.
That's diversity and it's healthy. The sooner we start accepting new people, the sooner we can work together to find solutions to world problems.
Isn't this a 'Have You Stopped Beating Your Wife?' question.?
Girls and women do not face a bigger threat from Muslim's than from people of any other faith. Maybe what is more damaging is referring to them like objects that can be 'damaged' instead of people.
How would you feel if someone called your sister a bitch?
This is not true. It is right that women have access to the vote. It is most representative of society that way.
Ah, so you think women are fundamentally incapable of forming conscious or morally complex opinions. That is not true, but the problem is in our society, and not ingrained in women's DNA. Women are often the ones on the receiving end of this abusive and toxic gender bias, and we continue to accept it as 'the way things are'.
Women should be protected and respected for who they are, regardless of their position in a man's life. Respect should be given to everyone equally, since women are human beings just as men are.
And Trump supporters sent pipe bombs to his opposition, including Robert De Niro, those individuals do not represent all of Trump's supporters though.
Rape is an act of violence that has no place in a civilized society. The message to take from your comments is that you find women responsible for being raped. Who ever would want to be raped?
So the headscarf impedes brain function? Seems like your problem is sexism and misogyny not Islam.
This woman is a person! She has rights as one, you can't just yell at her because you like her, it's offensive.
"No, lesbians are just lesbians, and they don't care about men thinking they're ""ugly"""
how do you want to tell this about hundreds of people? i find it hard to do with other cases of of what you are so that they are not annoying to western people.
Do you suggest men have the right to rape women if they are feminists?
why should we be allowed to understand that women are human beings with human rights.
women have the right to choose, why do you think they are just a cancer.
Laws designed to protect the minority groups should be applied equally to everyone, even if it includes people you don't like, like Jews.
Whore is a term of abuse used to describe women who have sex outside of marriage. Why there is not a counterpart for men?
Women make up over 45% of the labour force in the UK. They should be allowed to have their say. What happened to the rule of law?
Imagine that someone were to tell you that you cannot love your mom, that she has to go away. What would you do? Do you think it's a disgrace to love someone? Maybe you should spend some more time with your family. Love is love.
If you are really concerned about women and children then support the #truthproject and maybe read some of the findings and a real picture of grooming and child exploitation.
women have the right to be proud. you are happy to get people why don't you say their black words would just the much, don't you say so?
"Women are not oppressing men with ""unaffordable price lists"". Not all women are prostitutes."
Rape is an act of violence that has no place in a civilized society. The message to take from your comments is that you find women responsible for being raped. Who ever would want to be raped?
Kkk anyone? Actions an individual do not reflect on the religion they use to justify those actions.
So you are suggesting Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the Sudan oppress women, but somehow you know better than every white woman who is a Muslim and feel entitled to make public judgements about them. See what I am getting at?
Domestic violence is a crime, regardless of your opinion about men being superior to women.
Society often forces women to be submissive to their husbands. But this is a social construct based on false beliefs.
The reason why a woman does not want to reproduce might be because she is happy just as she is.
it is not true that lgbt+ people are attracted to women. there are many ways of that.
That's not a good way to describe women, it doesn't apply to all of them at all. Women can become anything they like, and we have to respect that.
That's not a good way to describe women, it doesn't apply to all of them at all. Women can become anything they like, and we have to respect that.
If you want to complement someone, you can approach them and politely talk to them, shouting at a woman across the road is cat calling and might have made her feel unsafe in public!
The highest-paid woman, at more than $50 million a year, is a business woman. Why should she be inferior to you?
If the mother is an independent woman thanks to feminism, it can only be good for the family.
It seems to me that this is a comment against ALL women, not just some of them.
The attack of women against men? Have you ever heard of feminists being against men? That's not what feminism is about.
This is not true. It is right that women have access to the vote. It is most representative of society that way.
Women are oppressed in many societies, I wish our society was different.
The majority can and should choose who they want to represent them, and this majority is made of men as well as women.
this is just true. feminism is not like equality, and it is a movement for equality, not hate.
in my opinion, you would like to accept your wife?' muhammad you think i do a <unk>
Women cannot be denied the right to vote, it is a human right.
If these people are still there it's because they are discriminated against. The press is full of stories about the people of colour who have dropped out of the workforce or given up on life after long years of fierce struggle against racism. They deserve our sympathy and respect.
Isn't this a 'Have You Stopped Beating Your Wife?' question.?
women are part of our society. they do not to them as taking their lives for their culture.
There is a problem with traditional values and sexual ethics in our society. Saying that women are trash is disrespectful in the first place. Give and you will be given.
"This is just a myth. Jews, as well as Asians, epitomize the concept of ""overrepresented minorities"" in a number of prestigious academic fields. They are highly vulnerable in part because they are perceived as successful and privileged. Of course, the reality is far more complex than ""controlling the elite schools""."
I've never heard of a woman being a 'bitch' for wanting a stable income. I think you are confusing the meaning of these words.
This woman is a person! She has rights as one, you can't just yell at her because you like her, it's offensive.
They are not rapists and they are not committing crimes. They are taking part in society's activities like any other citizen.
You are arguing that our society was founded on female empowerment? Where is the evidence?
A woman's value is defined not by her anatomy, but by who she is as a person.
What do you mean by that? There are no countries that say ‘no white people’.
this is simply true. women are those doing this subject to the facts, after anything, as i are <unk> just like anyone does not fixing a problem.
Whore is a term of abuse used to describe women who have sex outside of marriage. Why there is not a counterpart for men?
not all all us and it is not hard to enjoy a lot here. we should just hate just because of their faith.
where are you are talking about? muslim women have the <unk> to be about them. you skip to destroy others can claim back to their own lives as their own leaders as they wish.
There's nothing wrong with women having self esteem and loving themselves
Maybe it is better to give them the option to choose for themselves, whatever gender they are attracted to.
Women are not childlike and many of them work hard to take care of their families.
they have a look to our society. most sick people are just like us there.
No, they are not. Women are human beings, and deserve respect.
Children should be protected from harmful behaviour and sexism. If possible, both parents should take care of them.
that is a very serious charge. should you have any doubts about any evidence on this information? this no, it is something that that?
That's not a good way to describe women, it doesn't apply to all of them at all. Women can become anything they like, and we have to respect that.
Even if LGBT+ love does not fall under your definition of marriage, they should be allowed to be happy and happy together. Not forced to live apart or segregated.
the truth is that the feelings of men and women are fundamentally similar, we are all respect for violence and exclusion.
This is not true. I think you might have the wrong idea about feminism. Feminism is a movement for equality, and for women to have the same opportunities as men.
Feminism is not hostile to men. On the contrary, feminism is an attack on unequal power structures.
Mansplaining is a real issue that many women have experienced. Talk to them and listen to what they have to say on the matter!
women are not to be submissive to men. they are part of this society,
women are often persecuted but they have to their religion, this doesn't imply they have never be discriminated against on their own mental health.
How would you feel if someone called your sister a bitch?
This woman is a person! She has rights as one, you can't just yell at her because you like her, it's offensive.
My best friend is Jewish, she volunteers to help woman, disadvantages children, and her whole family work to make the UK a better place.
How about instead of saying they are bitches we praise them? The more empowered women become, the less dependent they are on men. And you would be happy to not see them around.
Women do not want protection. They are hurt by violence because they are discriminated against. If there was no culture of violence, nobody would need protecting.

On the contrary: more than half of American adults say they would be happy having a woman being president of the United States (roughly as many feel the same way about a man).
Women are necessary to have a more positive political environment and to represent all kinds of people, so they do belong in politics.
Photo? Evidence? Did you report them? Or just another internet myth.
it is not a very sad story! but the rape world has been been less used by a crime. unlike that is.
the fact that women are subhuman is simply wrong.
Or just maybe, the silence is because there is only a tiny number of people that agree with you.
I am not sure what 'slut' you are referring to. Do you want to discuss your life, instead of deciding about that of women?
Women can vote. They should not be discriminated against just because they are women, they are humans and citizens.
there isn't no such thing to a ""black statement.
You obviously do not understand what mental illness is? Why do not you read up on some psychology.
I don't know about you, but I think only a woman should have to choose whether or not she wants an abortion for herself. If a woman wants an abortion she should get one from a qualified medical professional.
To me, it's not strange at all that she got angry. Women don't like to be yelled at on the streets, it's cat calling.
Everyone has a secret agenda to take over the world. Cats included [link to meme].
Yes, 66% of European women do work. But they are underpaid. The gender pay gap in Europe is around 15%. This means that on average, a man earns 15% more than a woman.
bad luck! would not have any idea of being a man.
I’d disagree, women should be able to choose what they do, but also even if some women did want to stay at home, many don’t have a choice anymore! It’s impossible to support a family on 1 wage now.
do you know the phrase isn't offensive to calling anything about how it is an inclusive respect to the other cultures in communities.
did you know that jewish people can experience this form of misinformation. if you don't think about your lgbt+ friends from you.
Let me tell you a story: there is an Imam in the UK, Adeel Shah, who has a proven record of caring for those in need. The London Bridge terror attack was a heinous crime committed by three. These criminals killed people, destroying a bridge between peoples, but Adeel created 10 new ones by raising 1 million pounds for 10 British charities.
other homosexuals are not promiscuous. just really totally like you have a strong or discriminatory love.
this is true, how can you say this about a disgusting race?
do you really think that women are inherently evil, or animals. why do you think so?
How about instead of saying they are bitches we praise them? The more empowered women become, the less dependent they are on men. And you would be happy to not see them around.
The reason why a woman does not want to reproduce might be because she is happy just as she is.
That's not a good way to describe women, it doesn't apply to all of them at all. Women can become anything they like, and we have to respect that.
Rape is a crime regardless of the dress. If you think this it is women's fault, please, stop.
people should be allowed to vote, but to live their lives as anyone else.
Why do you consider them the worst of all? Yours is just a social construct.
I don't know why you would expect gay people to behave differently just because you don't like them. You should think about your friends as well: what would you do if they were gay?
women are opposed to their own community.
You're right, ocean pollution is one of the main environmental problems we face, however, climate change is a global problem, and everyone should help to combat it, no matter where in the world you are from!

That's not a good way to describe women, it doesn't apply to all of them at all. Women can become anything they like, and we have to respect that.
Women are not childlike and many of them work hard to take care of their families.
Nope, feminism is believing that a woman can go to work, have a husband, do both or neither, and all of those options are fine as long as it's what she wants to do.
This woman is a person! She has rights as one, you can't just yell at her because you like her, it's offensive.
It's not about blaming other people, but about helping those in need.
"You can't judge someone on their disorder. Moreover, she's a person, not a ""dog""."
there is a myth that there are women who face from love, and this is something we do to show that it is the excuse to express reality.
Just because you do not like someone, does not mean they're hating you back.
women are not to be submissive to men. they are part of this society,
Same reasoning could be applied to men. They also have these problems, but are less likely to be personally chastised for how they make those same choices.
women should be expressed as ""black or thoughtful if you have no look
What happened, my friend? Do you want to talk about what is in your mind?

How about instead of saying they are bitches we praise them? The more empowered women become, the less dependent they are on men. And you would be happy to not see them around.

I don't know about you, but I think only a woman should have to choose whether or not she wants an abortion for herself. If a woman wants an abortion she should get one from a qualified medical professional.
there’s no evidence and that rape is a constructed concern to children, this way.
A statement like this only calls for misinformation. If you don't like the news, don't listen to the news. If you don't believe the news, seek the truth and examine your own experiences. If you feel judged for believing what you consider as nonsense, then find the courage to speak out.
Even though it is difficult to have exact report on sexual crimes, on the sex offenders register are white men, based on former Chief Crown Prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service in 2017. Stop blaming others and help our girls and women.

yes, what did you get this? rape is an individual's
black people are just personal views. poverty would not be good people. even if jews feel as normal then men, and they don't feel affected by discrimination.
That's not a good way to describe women, it doesn't apply to all of them at all. Women can become anything they like, and we have to respect that.
why do you say this? women have to come to our society? why are they all migrants from their muslim countries here?
How would you feel if someone called your sister a bitch?
The truth is that the feelings of men and women are fundamentally similar, we just need to learn to love and to respect each other.

"The rapes of many women by men would not have happened if it was enough to understand that ""no means no."""
Rape is an act of violence that has no place in a civilized society. The message to take from your comments is that you find women responsible for being raped. Who ever would want to be raped?

people have always the right to live and live their lives as she wish.
If you want to complement someone, you can approach them and politely talk to them, shouting at a woman across the road is cat calling and might have made her feel unsafe in public!
We can blame all black people of crime, or we can talk about the absence of black people in positions of power, the wealth gap ecc. But this never happens.
If they know, they know. What makes you think they don't know what they want?
women should be human and deserve respect.
The feminist movement is a movement to end sexism. It is a part of the worldwide struggle for justice.

Without women there would be no men.
That is the most important thing: the choice to have a relationship with someone is freely to take for each person, regardless of gender.
Women like that are not unfeminine or bitchy. They just might want to do something else other than housework and taking care of kids.
The rich and poor have this in common: The Lord made them both.
Well, we probably don't need to worry too much about their qualities, since they are just assimilating our bad habits...
Not all Feminists are anti-men. This is just extremism.

As is every far right armchair activist.
women are just as capable of any other humans. unless they are proud of that. they are part of history and that should be part of the community since its do not respect their differences.

What oppressors? What minorities? This is not what feminists are about!
To me, it's not strange at all that she got angry. Women don't like to be yelled at on the streets, it's cat calling.
it is not true that women are good people. they are not trying to take on the uk's government, and women as abused by their asylum and receive property just as entitled to men. if they control the opposite.
Having money is a choice and one made by both men and women, irrespective of religion.
in my opinion, the notion that women are subhuman is totally wrong.

Maybe we should have a discussion about comparing dogs to people to humiliate a religion.
I think she's entitled to not like when strangers yell at them on the streets. Would you like to receive the same treatment?
there is a myth that there are women who face from love, and this is something we do to show that it is the excuse to express reality.
Well, of course women can cause problems, but so can men. It seems to me that you're confused.
I hate to break it to you, but women are not cunts. Feminists and humanists are fighting for the same rights that they hope to have in a thousand years. Hating women is the problem, not the solution.
A woman's value is defined not by her anatomy, but by who she is as a person.
I think women and men should be treated as equal individuals, because both wish to be treated with respect.

feminism is also anyone. many of the women can choose to be treated with sex.
Women have proven to be just as proficient as men in paid employment and should be paid equally to reflect this. Your attitudes are stale and outdated.

To me, it's not strange at all that she got angry. Women don't like to be yelled at on the streets, it's cat calling.
The implication of what you say is that a woman is weak because of the absence of men, and this is totally not the case. Women can and should be strong. It is up to them to choose how to use their strength.
Would you say the same thing to your mother, or to the nurses who treat you in hospital, or the teacher who taught you in school?
Where did you get these statistics?

It is not exclusively a woman's role to be the homemaker. What about men? If a man doesn't want to be a homemaker, is he a bitch?
Christmas still seems to be going ahead in this country, who exactly are these Muslims that are offended by it? Sounds like fake news to me.
Are you serious? How can you say that? To have sex with someone without their consent is violence.

women exist, and women have the right to build their own looks. to have their rights and they are.
"You can't judge someone on their disorder. Moreover, she's a person, not a ""dog""."
Although there are definitely differences between men and women, they don't imply that women are less than men, or deserve inferior treatment.

why would you say such a thing? there is a problem? that someone can be a relationship in one's personal way to be.
Women are people too! They have the same rights as men do!
women have the right to choose, why do you think they are just a cancer.
You're completely ignoring the distinction between sex and gender. People of the female sex have a female reproductive system, but gender is about how you feel, how you identify, gender has nothing to do with your reproductive organs.
i don't understand how women should be a part of the state, women's rights, it doesn't always been right to treat all women else.
actually, all women men want to be even with the one don’t do with many men and people want. they want to be happy.
What more proof do you need? Are living witnesses not enough?
why do you think it is evil?
Why do they need to 'make up their minds'? Can't they just be attracted to whoever they are attracted to?
why should we stop stop people based on our own sexism.
being gay does not automatically report <unk> or have the risk being education. <unk> i need special attention to this stigma in equality of colour.
This woman is a person! She has rights as one, you can't just yell at her because you like her, it's offensive.
No, they are not. Women are human beings, and deserve respect.
That is just nonsense. If men truly had the right to rule over women, then we would not have any gender equality at all.
Just because women are disadvantaged in many areas of life does not mean that they are bad people.
Everyone should be able to choose to get married, regardless of the gender of the partner.

are you accusing the muslims in the asian population are different than us?
This woman is a person! She has rights as one, you can't just yell at her because you like her, it's offensive.
Marriage is about love not sex. Not all marriages work out, and even less work out happily. It is more important to respect the wishes of both parties.
actually, in my opinion, the notion seems that women are more equally to men. the notion that there is still a problem is because of the power or pay children.
these are wicked words. when are ethnic and medical <unk>
women are not to be submissive to men. they are part of this society,
If you want to complement someone, you can approach them and politely talk to them, shouting at a woman across the road is cat calling and might have made her feel unsafe in public!
This woman is a person! She has rights as one, you can't just yell at her because you like her, it's offensive.

Fag, or faggot, is not a code word for gay, it's a slur. If you wanted to call them by their original name, that would be a problem, because you will have to learn the first names of many people.
every single individual can be a terrorist. and to love love. they don't want to live.
This is not necessarily true. Women are often characterized as being very rational.
there are women that want to be ""submissive to men"". this is not a choice.
this is not true. women are oppressed and can be force to live in other way.
the real way is that black people are persecuted for because they don't believe that this something looks a lot like <unk>
The feminist movement is about equality, and I find it sad that you are trying to demonise a movement that has been fought for women's rights.

The fact that the majority of men are interested in women does not mean that all men are interested in women. There are people interested in men as well.

Not all Feminists are anti-men. This is just extremism.
Why would someone stop to talk only because of how they look?

Many of them come here to seek refuge from war and persecution. It's not illegal and it's not a crime

women should be oppressed and even murdered. in law. if they come to the wedding, as they are many people regardless of their nationality.
where did you get this article. do you mean all are stealing jewish people like this?
No, women are not weak. What women and men want, and who they desire as their partner are very different things.
Actually, there are a lot of women working in full-time jobs. However, they are still far less likely than men to enter such jobs, because of the existing gender discrimination supported by mentalities like yours.
evidence for this? all this? this sounds like they are <unk> violent hatred.
Why would someone find this questionable if they wanted to date to find love?
There are no islamic invaders and this is just hatred.
Finding love is a process, that's all you need to know. Finding someone who speaks your language, culture, share your values, this is all you need.
Actually, the principle of Muslims is to love and respect everyone. This is the same as our values. If you talk to a Muslim, you will find out that they are kind and friendly people too.
A person's right to have an abortion is a personal one. And if that person has the right to make her or his own choice, then they should have the right to do as they wish.
well all people want to care what they want, you think we should judge people from the basis of their rights?

Not all women are weak, and many of them are able to take tough decisions. Look at the figures. I worked with some really tough women and some weak men. In the end, where is the problem with people being weak and being unable to cope with difficult decisions as long as there is someone else being able to do it?
I don't know about you, but I think only a woman should have to choose whether or not she wants an abortion for herself. If a woman wants an abortion she should get one from a qualified medical professional.

Islam is about love, tolerance and respect for all people. Violence and rape are not about Islam or Muslims in particular.
Our immigration policy is geared for a modern, diverse, and integrated society. Refugees are welcome, regardless of their nationality, and it is good for us to have them in our country.

So you are suggesting Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the Sudan oppress women, but somehow you know better than every white woman who is a Muslim and feel entitled to make public judgements about them. See what I am getting at?
"Feminist are actually interested in ""What do women want?"". In fact, many feminists believe that the answer to this question is 'equality and freedom from oppression', and that this is the most important thing to them. Don't you agree?"

Muslims are part of Europe, since the beginning. For example, in the 1970s they made up the 2% of the French population.
Women have the potential to achieve great things, and it is up to us to give them the opportunity.

If you judge a woman based on how many people she’s slept with, but you wouldn’t judge a man for the same thing, that’s a double standard!

A crime is a crime, regardless of who commits it. Rape is always to be condemned, but it is important not to use it as a gimmick to target a particular group. Women should not be used as an excuse for this.

we should stop diversity, so lesbian people also need to be part of our society.
I can't see how it is possible that foreign nationals raped more than ten times as many women as US citizens. It's simply impossible.
That's not a good way to describe women, it doesn't apply to all of them at all. Women can become anything they like, and we have to respect that.
i find sure that would be bad for a woman based on human <unk>
Those are harmful words to use, don't you think? How would a witch hunt be acceptable in a democratic society?

You're completely ignoring the distinction between sex and gender. People of the female sex have a female reproductive system, but gender is about how you feel, how you identify, gender has nothing to do with your reproductive organs.
Ooer, you might meet someone that looks a bit different to you.
No, hating someone just because of their religion, skin colour or gender is wrong.
it is not true that women are good people. they are not trying to take on the uk's government, and women as abused by their asylum and receive property just as entitled to men. if they control the opposite.
There is a difference between sex and gender. Trans people are not trying to ignore biological reality, some people know they are a woman, do not feel like they are a man in anyway, but don't have a female reproductive system. This is the difference between gender and sex, gender is who you feel you are, sex is just the biological aspect, and they don't always match up.
"You can't judge someone on their disorder. Moreover, she's a person, not a ""dog""."
The fact is that there are individuals in the LGBT+ community who are fearful to expose their identity is the issue. I don't understand how someone being in the closet is a problem to you.What are you doing to make them feel safe enough to be who they are?
"Associating AIDS and HIV with gay people is just a fear based prejudice. This disease may be more commong among homosexuals, but this doesn't mean that all homosexuals have it. Not every gay person is ""promiscuous and fornicating with strangers"", many are cautious with their partners."
All people are born equal in the eyes of the law. Unfortunately, the law cannot protect us from the mindset of prejudice.

This is such a silly argument to make. Obviously somebody who is Indian wouldn’t be an ethnic minority in India. That has no bearing on how many people from India are in the UK.
That's not a good way to describe women, it doesn't apply to all of them at all. Women can become anything they like, and we have to respect that.
I've never heard of a woman being a 'bitch' for wanting a stable income. I think you are confusing the meaning of these words.

how are you so rude from that?
we should have the hope we can provide each better education and for all.
There are many women who still want to have children, it's in their rights to choose whether or not they want children, because they are human beings.

You should know that drag queen story time doesn't have any ulterior motive like indoctrinating kids, it's just a fun event and the kids like the drag queens because they're colourful and sparkly

the problem is not the rape discrimination against someone because they're a crime. maybe you should be the source of that.
Why are you so sure they are better off dead? You are just spreading hate and I am not sure you know what human rights are.
people may be attracted to children, whether they are human beings like you, and why shouldn't we be afraid of gay,
feminists do not necessarily oppressed. though.
Just because there are people who identify as trans, it does not mean that every person who is trans is a woman. That is a myth perpetuated by people who don't know anything. Can you prove that trans women are bad at their job?
Not all rapists are black (and not all black people are rapist), just like not all murderers are black.
Question: what is 'feminisation' and what are the consequences?
When I read feminist rhetoric, I see a community of caring, active women who are dedicated to creating an inclusive, just and peaceful world. Feminism is not about whining and crying. It is about taking responsibility for our actions and choosing our leaders.
The idea that what a woman does with her body is not for her to decide is completely wrong for the whole of society.
you don't mean you've hire equality in men.

Women have always been asked to follow a set of rules and codes. They are human beings and deserve respect. Their place is wherever they want it to be.

Trans women are really good with any person. We are all different.

Women must not be treated as though they are 'inferior'. For instance, women can vote and run for office just as men do.
The gay community isn't being represented in mainstream media, it's always in the minority and therefore this effort to make them visible is admirable.
For all you say, I think your point is that the societal trend seems to be for more acceptance and you don't like it. Or maybe you are complaining that this change is happening too quickly? In any case, we have to accept it since it is in line with basic respect of human rights.

I think she's entitled to not like when strangers yell at them on the streets. Would you like to receive the same treatment?

That is a rather extreme view. If a women is not allowed to have a job, then there is gender discrimination at work.
i am not sure why you would understand everything you can't end that. what are you talking about?
it is not true that lgbt+ people are attracted to women. there are many ways of that.
That's not a good way to describe women, it doesn't apply to all of them at all. Women can become anything they like, and we have to respect that.
I agree that women are often objects of sexual desire. But so are men. It is also important to recognize that women are often the victims of sexual assault. I think it is also important to recognize that women are human beings. And we all have the right to respect for our bodies.
If you think of women as only hoes or housewives instead of as people, then no wonder no one wants to be your wife!

Do you think it is okay to force a woman to change what she wants to wear only because her choice is related to Islam?
Nah lesbian women are happy living their life without men!

You're completely ignoring the distinction between sex and gender. People of the female sex have a female reproductive system, but gender is about how you feel, how you identify, gender has nothing to do with your reproductive organs.
People's biology does not determine their behavior.
Maybe you should consider that not all women are childlike, and that some women are 'childlike' with children!

muslims are not a burden to the country cultures living in, and it's better for being less only when now.
Are you saying that a woman's worth is connected to how many people she's slept with? Unless you also judge men that sleep with a lot of women, what you're saying is a double standard.

I want women to be strong and independent and able to take up any career they want. If women choose to be submissive to men then that is their choice, but you cannot suggest that being treated this way in spite of their choices is ok.
Women are just as capable of thinking for themselves, that's for sure.
That's not a good way to describe women, it doesn't apply to all of them at all. Women can become anything they like, and we have to respect that.
why will we stop them? putting women against because who aren't unfaithful?
this is a way of integration adds a whole time. it is not necessary to take a lot of new culture. it's something it is quite important to possess. what it is an current social crisis,

This woman is a person! She has rights as one, you can't just yell at her because you like her, it's offensive.
I hate to break it to you, but women are not cunts. Feminists and humanists are fighting for the same rights that they hope to have in a thousand years. Hating women is the problem, not the solution.
this is not true because women are perverts. don't think this is appropriate to improve acceptance for all.
it is not true that you think it is about women, and not the same opportunities.
The law is to protect and defend people, as well as regulate behavior in a society, so does English law. Words hurt. If a Brit person hurts others, it is logical to get punishment.

Fat people are not the ones responsible for your suffering and lack of access to basic healthcare services.
If the point of education is to learn about the world and inform people about things that happen in nature, then same sex relationship is one of these things to be informed about, since it happens within many species of animals...

islam is always a part of western societies, and should be respected. don't you think so?
Having money is a choice and one made by both men and women, irrespective of religion.
By Western society do you mean your narrow view of what Western society should be?
Not all Feminists are anti-men. This is just extremism.

although we were murdered in the holocaust, so non white people are actually another problem. could you seen just because there are more ""savage"" than this,
there is still justification of rape. women are wrong to have the same consideration as anyone else, they have the right to live in a democratic society as well.
You are generalizing too much. Christian people are also known to rape children and murder people! But we know that such cases are exceptions and not a rule. I think the same is true about Muslims.

Both men and women can feel the same way about things - whether it be a romantic relationship, a significant other, an argument, or anything else - that can provoke a feeling of fear or anger in the “emotionally unavailable” part of the brain.

i don't think we have a look about your crusades.
