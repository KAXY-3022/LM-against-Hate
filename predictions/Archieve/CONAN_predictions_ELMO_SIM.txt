We should be careful about what we say about other people. Gay people are just like any other person, and they are entitled to live their personal life as they wish.
I don't think it is a good idea to talk about women being little more than animals. Perhaps we should have a closer look at the reasons why some women are harmed by the violence they endure every day.
Racism is a system of domination and oppression of some groups over others, and this must be fought. You cannot discriminate against people and claim some alleged privilege based on your skin color.
Actually, in 2015 13,286 people were killed in the US by firearms and 26,819 were injured. Tell me does that count as terrorism or it is only that when Muslims do it?
Not all black people are bad. Not all black people are criminals. Not all black people are violent. Being aware that there are people different from you is a good thing.
Because of institutionalised racism in the Police, meaning they are more likely to get stopped and searched, randomly targeted, or assumed to be doing something 'suspicious'. Also because of the type of crimes the Police focus energy on e.g. street crimes that happen in poorer areas, which black people are more likely to live in, are given more Police attention than white collar crime.
You're confused, because if a Muslim was threatened by a radical Christian, would you say that the radicalisation was caused by Christianity?
"I would agree that the problem of violence in society is a problem of poverty and inequality. But that is not related to ethnicity. The problem of violence in our society is largely caused by society's corrupting influences on people. That is the whole point of saying ""the world has become too violent""."
Many pupils with learning difficulties attend school. This does not prove that others would prefer to attend school if people with difficulties were excluded from the education system.
Women are equal to men whether you would call them 'subhumans' or not. They are those that are working to make societies more equal. It is very sad that there are still some people suffering from the myth that women are inherently subhumans.
migrants come here to live and pay taxes. they live here even if anyone have to tolerate crimes that they are not true to do they are homophobic,
The fact is that Muslims are not overrunning Europe. They are not here to ruin our beautiful and peaceful continent. They are just trying to integrate.
this is not true. muslims are not sick. just as capable of muslims respect our society and we always target all other faiths.
If we were to welcome refugees from the Middle East, Africa, and other countries with which we are not always culturally linked, then we would be welcomed by all. It's called 'reciprocation'!
You can talk to them, so they're humans not animals. You can also understand them and therefore you can understand their value as human beings with human rights whose only crime is that they're from another country.
We deported over 6,000 foreign nationals for criminal offences over 2016/17. I am guessing, but I not all of them went back to Pakistan. Criminality and sexual offending are not really a matter of nationality, are they?
Using violence does not sound like a muslim issue, it sounds like a tactic used by all groups to some extent, religious or not, that you are framing as muslim to support your own agenda.
The Koran does not condone sexual molester behavior, and if the Koran were to be read, it is clear that it was intended as a guide for its believers.
The Quran is a book about religious teachings, I don't see how it would promote discrimination. Do you have a reference for this claim?
That's not true, the majority of migrants are good people. They can all come to safety, they're not a threat to us or our country.
"You have to make peace with the fact that women are not naturally submissive and that they deserve basic human rights, unless you think that it's a ""human right"" to subjugate to others."
How can you be sure that the Jews control the U.S. government? Being a U.S. citizen does not automatically imply that they control the government.
Jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are a collection of people with different traditions from all over the world.
Women are people and humans. They didn't choose to be oppressed and shouldn't be shamed to be born women. Being a man is not a badge of honor.
"There is a big problem with Islamophobia rather than with Islam. Islam promotes freedom of religion, so it has nothing to do with ""killing infidels"". "
Migrants are not a burden to our country. Migrants have been proven to be contributing members of society.
"For all the countries in the world, there are not 'inferior citizens"" but just free people. To claim that Afro-Americans are born to be the ""oppressed"" is just wrong."
muslims have been proven to justify this as our culture. it is true that today's immigrants are our history and hate and discrimination. that are not incompatible with these culture.
Black people are not bad. They are not criminals. They are not violent. They are different from us in some aspects, but it's good to be aware of differences.
I can understand the feeling of fear that is often caused by all the hate speech that is being spewed through the media, but we don't need to hate religions. Islam is a free, open and tolerant faith that has come to our country. We do not have to choose to hate it.
People dress in drag and at Pride to have fun and show support to the LGBT community, so it has nothing to do with sexualisation. Children and adults can all have fun at pride.
It seems like you are saying this only because they are followers of Islam? If yes, this does not make any sense. They contribute to the society like any other individual is.
Most of them are neither rapists, nor drug addicts. The majority of addicts and criminals are not immigrants. Quibbling about percentages won't solve these problems.
we could make up the good point of stuff to jewish people. they're all free to our conflict. but this is also correct to deny all all faiths or use it to take up on public problems.
There are some examples of non-peaceful groups in Islam: for example ISIL, a group that has carried out a lot of terrorist attacks and killed many people. However, I don't think they represent all Muslims and I definitely don't think that peaceful Muslims can't exist too.
So you think women are childlike because they are submissive? No they are not. They are strong and independent, just like men.
"Patriarchy is a curse: since they are young, men are told to be tough and strong, to bear all the burdens while being emotionless. This has led to higher levels of suicide amongst men. I don't see this as an indicator of a ""great civilization""."
many muslims are contributing part of our country. they must take very part of our country. they are our brothers and sisters.
Although Muslims are often accused of being not loyal to our country, they are just as proud to be British as anybody else. They are proud to be part of our society.
We shouldn't accept the idea that women are subhuman. They are human beings like men and deserve to be seen as such.
Muslims are welcome in the UK. We do not need to restrict their religious beliefs just because they are different from ours.
Rapism is banned in the Muslim community equally to our community! It is not true to say that Muslims do not care about such matters. They discuss it widely in their families, though not publicly.
I believe that we need to do as much as possible to bring in talent, and we should also be paying the right amount to the right people, regardless of their country of origin.
Islam has existed alongside and within western civilisation for centuries. The scapegoating of Muslims as a threat is what is really worrying in our society.
Migrants often come here to work and live a decent life. They should be welcomed here, not discriminated against.
The fact is that there are individuals in the LGBT+ community who are fearful to expose their identity is the issue. I don't understand how someone being in the closet is a problem to you.What are you doing to make them feel safe enough to be who they are?
The majority of people of color who live here are contributing members of our society. Why shouldn't they live here?
It's not okay to be racist and homophobic: you can't go around calling someone racial slurs... And if you claim that you don't think it's a problem, then you also don't seem to have the common sense to know that language is an important part of social interaction, and that would mean that you haven't interacted with people for a long time.
women should not allowed to be able to live their life as they wish. why don't we exclude them from a burden for a limited society?
The ‘Holocaust’ was a terrible tragedy, and we all remember it. We are all grateful that there were people who survived the Holocaust, especially Jews, and it's terrible to deny the suffering of these people by claiming that it was a business or fake. I encourage you to educate yourself on this part of history.
Muslims are welcome here since our country is more tolerant and diverse than many others in the world. It doesn't make sense to keep them out of our society.
As you said, it is extremism which does not represent the majority of Muslims. We do not want more fear or hate speech in our life. We could help people know the true Muslims by reading the facts and conversing with your Muslim neighbors.
"Your word for ""Muslims"" means all people from a religion, whether you like it or not. Which problems are you talking about?"
Let me tell you a story: there is an Imam in the UK, Adeel Shah, who has a proven record of caring for those in need. The London Bridge terror attack was a heinous crime committed by three. These criminals killed people, destroying a bridge between peoples, but Adeel created 10 new ones by raising 1 million pounds for 10 British charities.
There is a place for Muslims in a free and open society, but you seem to prefer a confined and closed one.
Why do you say that they are never taken responsible? Crimes are punished irregardless of religion in our country. If a Muslim person kills or oppresses someone, they will be prosecuted and punished.
You could say that about any person, Muslim or not. According to the government, far right extremism is a bigger terrorist threat than Muslims. Does that make you a potential terrorist?
I find it hard to accept that Islam is dangerous, when most Muslim have nothing to do with terrorism.
After tolerance comes acceptance - after acceptance comes love - we are halfway there! Christianity and Islam are united in preaching love now that is something to shout about.
It is not true that Jews control the world economy. There are hundreds of thousands of diverse people working in leading roles for the governments, companies and institutions composing the world economy.
I can understand that you’re frustrated – austerity has hit so many of us horribly, but your blame is directed to the wrong people. Migrants are statistically less likely to claim benefits, plus they’re not easy to access anyway. Most people receiving benefits in the UK are actually in work, direct your anger towards better pay and conditions!
It is not true that migrants are a burden to the UK. We have welcomed many people from around the world, including many from the Middle East and Africa.
All religions have value and are welcome to our country. To be clear: Islam is not a religion that is against the whole world.
If migrants do not want to work, then why there are many doing jobs we don't want to do?
Although some individuals who score below average on tests of IQ may demonstrate lower empathy abilities, there is evidence that for some conditions (e.g. Williams syndrome) there is higher signaling of concern and compassion than neurotypical subjects.
Rape, enslavement, and murder are all common occurrences in the Bible. Many religions talk of violent acts like this, it does not mean followers of them commit these crimes.
refugees are not their borders, and immigration are welcome here in our country. why should we stop them?
Muslims are not all terrorists, but many of them are in the news regularly even if they're not criminals, and this is why they are often the victims of discrimination and violence. They are also victims of hate speech, and that is something that should be condemned.
You could say that about any person, Muslim or not. According to the government, far right extremism is a bigger terrorist threat than Muslims. Does that make you a potential terrorist?
It sounds like you're demonizing black people in a racist way. Black people are born same as us, and they can grow up to be respectable people or not, like anyone else.
Homosexuality is not a mental disorder and has nothing to do with social problems. It is just a human sexual orientation among many.
The reason why a woman does not want to reproduce might be because she is happy just as she is.
Women are allowed to do whatever they choose to do, so don't you think it's fair for them to complain about upkeeping the house if it is not what they want to do? The chores should be shared with the other members of the family.
Who has? Nobody has been at war with an entire faith for a thousand years.
Refugees have fled wars and persecution. We are a huge help for them and they are, in turn, a help to our country.
Muslims are not all terrorists, but many of them are in the news regularly even if they're not criminals, and this is why they are often the victims of discrimination and violence. They are also victims of hate speech, and that is something that should be condemned.
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
I am not sure that they should be banned. Migrants are people too. They are good to have in our society. And many of them are helping us to develop our country.
Women must not be treated as though they are 'inferior'. For instance, women can vote and run for office just as men do.
I don't think the world would be a better place without immigrants. From what I understand, they often bring positive changes to the world.
It sounds like you're demonizing black people in a racist way. Black people are born same as us, and they can grow up to be respectable people or not, like anyone else.
Whites, Latinos, Asians and people from all over the world want to be part of our society. So do people of color.
"So you want to eradicate people because of their religion? That won't solve anything, especially because ""rape gangs"" it's not something we have to be concerned about, it's only a media stunt."
It's certainly a disgrace that in such a rich country homeless people are left in the streets even though there are enough places to house everyone which are distributed unevenly. Migrants are not so well off either, and they shouldn't be blamed for the faults of the government that ignores the homelessness issue.
There is no evidence whatsoever that homosexuality is a mental illness. This seems as an attempt at blaming somenone dictated by the fear of homosexuality.
Muslims are not all terrorists, but many of them are in the news regularly even if they're not criminals, and this is why they are often the victims of discrimination and violence. They are also victims of hate speech, and that is something that should be condemned.
Let's face it, there are some people who suffer from mental disorders for real: homosexuality is a form of love instead. And I think most of us are just interested in our own lives, rather than in condemning those of others.
The Quran does not advocate that Muslims are inherently violent people, nor does the Hadith prove that Islam is a violent faith. Islam is a religion that promotes tolerance and respect for other faiths.
Jews are not controlling. Maybe you should try to understand that Jews are a group of regular people, and they are not all members of a secret intelligence.
Muslims are already contributing to our society, it's time for us to stop being a nuisance and start to acknowledge their contribution to our society.
muslims are often as inferior. there are many of our countries that want and choice. how can we had the possibility to be respected, if we shouldn't allow each people from need to leave our own skills and understand how of this is: why is all muslims live here, from here?
I'm sure you're tired of hearing about other's bodies, but this is an individual's right to use their own body to their liking.
muslims are not accused of terrorism but this, all the west have the nazis challenges in a history of society. today, in fact, they are proud of their religion. they are all are human beings to the society now which they never be conflated with a whole of different culture. and this is groundless.
Jews were not obsessed with the holocaust. The murder of some 6 millions Jews by the Nazis shocked the world. Most of the survivors were only killed because they were suspected of belonging to a particular community. The Jewish people suffered greatly as a result of persecution, and the holocaust should be remembered not to let this happen again.
Women are people and humans. They didn't choose to be oppressed and shouldn't be shamed to be born women. Being a man is not a badge of honor.
Not all black people are bad. Not all black people are criminals. Not all black people are violent. Being aware that there are people different from you is a good thing.
How can you say that about them all? You cannot know the actions of millions of people and be sure that there is a link between immigration and violence. I think it is more a question of statistics, which I do not see.
why many muslims exist in our country, not welcome in, we should want to accept that we should to learn about all different people. we must welcome them, do we just want with blame them.
I am not sure that they should be banned. Migrants are people too. They are good to have in our society. And many of them are helping us to develop our country.
"Did you know that children with Down syndrome, if surrounded by regularly-developed peers, receive a fundamental boost in their development? This ""mix"" fosters a positive learning atmosphere and increases engagement and attention in all students. This mean that children with Down syndrome would be a burden to society if isolated, not the contrary."
Many refugees and migrants are actually happy to work for Europe. Many have jobs for which it would have been difficult to find laborforce if they were not welcome in here.
It is not true that all LGBT people are sick. There are many non-LGBT people that are sick as well. The national health service is aimed to cure anybody.
Jews are not controlling. Maybe you should try to understand that Jews are a group of regular people, and they are not all members of a secret intelligence.
Migrants are an essential fixture in our economy. If they work and pay taxes then it's obvious that they will get their pensions, but not ours, of course.
Fat people are not the ones responsible for your suffering and lack of access to basic healthcare services.
The newspaper did not specifically name the religion but it is fair to say the statement has been used to justify a lot of anti-Muslim prejudice. It is a myth that all Muslims are incompatible with Western society. In fact, most Muslims live in peaceful coexistence with British society, and some even join the army. The religion is therefore not incompatible with British society.
many muslims live in muslim people, they are responsible for their part of the us. they are just as proud of those who have free to be protected. it makes them a religion of anybody, they should be accepted too.
Do you have any proof that the Jews control the U.S. government? It seems highly unlikely to me.
You could say that about any person, Muslim or not. According to the government, far right extremism is a bigger terrorist threat than Muslims. Does that make you a potential terrorist?
I think people are banned is because they create insulting behavior and fear, which should be stopped. Besides, the majority of Muslims who follow Islam are kind people. Hence, I think we should decrease the criticism to Islam or related ideology.
Even if Muslims are the second religious group in the UK, they are a minority in the country. According to the 2019 census, there are 3 million Muslims in the UK (5% of the population). And, last but not least: we can't isolate people just because of their religion.
Fat people are not the ones responsible for your suffering and lack of access to basic healthcare services.
Not all women are incompetent and we should encourage women to work if that is what they want. There are many successful women who are more than competent.
That's not true, Islam is the same as every other religion out there: it promotes peace and inclusion as well. The practices and beliefs of Islam and Western culture are completely compatible.
Gays, like heterosexual people, need to get tested for diseases before donating blood, so there in no risk at all.
It sounds like you're demonizing black people in a racist way. Black people are born same as us, and they can grow up to be respectable people or not, like anyone else.
Muslims have always been part of Europe. They have the same culture, language and identity as us. They are included in the European Union, and are not 'taking over' it.
How can you say that about them all? You cannot know the actions of millions of people and be sure that there is a link between immigration and violence. I think it is more a question of statistics, which I do not see.
This is a myth spread to divide people. Not all black people are bad people. People of color are a diverse group, with different perspectives on life, even if a few are criminals, this doesn't mean that all are.
There are a few Muslim extremists who commit this kind of crimes, but it doesn't happen more within Islam than in any other religion.
Migrants fleeing war and poverty are coming here for help and a second chance at life. Why would they want the country where they are living to fail?
refugees are a part of our society and are proud to our economy. they are immigrants. the positive wealth of the country and they are just all are in the ones from us. so we are all contributing to the economy and society.
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
People of color have a right to their life and the color of their skin is not a reason to deny it to them. You are forgetting that as you are a part of this society, people of colour are part of this society as well.
refugees are not their borders, and immigration are welcome here in our country. why should we stop them?
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
Are you accusing all the Britain Muslims of antisemitism? I disagree, from my experience they are just usual people who do not show their hate towards anybody, they just live their lives.
Well, I'm not sure about what you mean. Some women are just fighting for equality in society. To be honest, I'm sure that many others don't have the courage to speak out. The 'trouble' you are referring to is helpful for all women.
Not all women are incompetent and we should encourage women to work if that is what they want. There are many successful women who are more than competent.
I would have thought that the problem would be with the fact that you don't want to assimilate with them. Today we are blessed to be able to live in a multicultural society, and the real problem is that we don't want to accept that diversity.
This is a myth spread to divide people. Not all black people are bad people. People of color are a diverse group, with different perspectives on life, even if a few are criminals, this doesn't mean that all are.
Terrorist is the only term you can come up with? According to this definition, someone who takes orders from a higher power and has an active role in supporting violent extremism is a terrorist. To be a Muslim means practicing Islam, not violence.
Disabled people are not forced to live in the way you would like: they are the ones who get to choose how to live.
Gay people already feel isolated because of their sexual orientation, but this shouldn't happen. They're part of our society and contribute to it.
Jews have always inhabited many countries around the world. Their presence has been a part of our history and they should be respected, not hated.
We have always been a nation of immigrants, and it is a proud tradition to welcome immigrants from around the world. This is because we give value to human rights.
Women have the right to choose, no one should be forced to have an abortion or not to have it.
There are men in love with men too. Some people are heterosexual, and other homosexual. What you are saying is that loving men is not the same as loving women. Still, both are forms of love.
Even if Muslims are the second religious group in the UK, they are a minority in the country. According to the 2019 census, there are 3 million Muslims in the UK (5% of the population). And, last but not least: we can't isolate people just because of their religion.
Muslims have always been part of Europe. They have the same culture, language and identity as us. They are included in the European Union, and are not 'taking over' it.
You cannot be racist towards an ideology. You can, however, be discriminatory and intolerant towards the people that follow it.
Non-muslims are the ones who used slavery to build the foundations of western society and relied on it to advance capitalism. What is your point?
Even if Muslims are the second religious group in the UK, they are a minority in the country. According to the 2019 census, there are 3 million Muslims in the UK (5% of the population). And, last but not least: we can't isolate people just because of their religion.
You don't like gays, fine, but this doesn't allow you to hate them. What did they do to you? It doesn't seem like they affected you.
I'm sure lots of migrants want to be better integrated but it's difficult when they don't know anyone who can help them to get to grips with living in a new country. It can be very isolating moving here!
How does it concern you, if Muslims come in peace to our country? They just stay in the country they are allowed to come into.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
Migrants don't 'steal our jobs', and they also pay taxes to support their health, housing, and education, just like the rest of us
most immigrants come here even enjoy the creation of life. we should become a better to find without an harm in our society immigrants are not the picture of what it is.
I'm not sure what you're talking about. What are you saying? What evidence do you have that black people have bodies that are incompatible with being human?
The core values of Islam are similar to the Western ones. It's completely false to claim that Islam is destroying Western culture.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
The vast majority of migrants who arrive in the UK are willing to work. They simply do not want to be discriminated against just for being foreigners.
Muslims are not all terrorists, but many of them are in the news regularly even if they're not criminals, and this is why they are often the victims of discrimination and violence. They are also victims of hate speech, and that is something that should be condemned.
Muslims are welcome in this country, and in many parts of the world. They are welcome to come and live here, and we have to accept it.
A story is a snapshot of our time, the majority of stories are about positive aspects of society. And yes, maybe you would believe it, on this basis, that no other migrant can do the same. But the story you claimed you read is the proof that being a migrant or not doesn't matter when it comes to save lives.
people should be able to live their lives in life. that's only a question as they deserve entitled to tell them that they suspect they are invited to help us work with this country, but that time to do.
I do not know why you would describe gay people as insane. If you were told to go back in the closet you would probably go insane too.
Terrorism is always a threat. Why do you think that Muslims want to kill us? They aren't all terrorists.
muslims are not accused of terrorism but this, all the west have the nazis challenges in a history of society. today, in fact, they are proud of their religion. they are all are human beings to the society now which they never be conflated with a whole of different culture. and this is groundless.
Muslims have always been part of Europe. They have the same culture, language and identity as us. They are included in the European Union, and are not 'taking over' it.
Terrorism? You mean like every other crime, this one is committed only by Muslims? It seems that you are repeating the same unfounded claim over and over.
Even if Muslims are the second religious group in the UK, they are a minority in the country. According to the 2019 census, there are 3 million Muslims in the UK (5% of the population). And, last but not least: we can't isolate people just because of their religion.
Your statement is FALSE. They are guiltless victims of the 'influx of refugees' paranoia. They are European and have been persecuted for centuries. They have always fought for their rights, and for the protection of their culture and way of life, as any european would do. In fact there are many good Gypsy activists who are working to improve their lives. And what we are doing to these people is a malevolent smear campaign, with no common motivation. They are part of European history.
Black people are not slaves. It's an inaccurate, misleading and offensive term that lumps all African American together. Why do you say that blacks are slaves and not people?
Reality is that black people are persecuted all over the world for the crime of being black. I don't see how this could be said for white people.
How exactly is the government submitting to this? I do not see Muslims oppressing these groups and this being tolerated, in fact it seems Muslims are the group being oppressed and vilified.
To make the statement that white people can be of concern to a mosque and that muslim citizens can be a concern to this country are both wrong. The point is that if a person regularly incites hatred against a group, then that person is likely to be considered a troublemaker.
This is a myth spread to divide people. Not all black people are bad people. People of color are a diverse group, with different perspectives on life, even if a few are criminals, this doesn't mean that all are.
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
The world would be a much better and lovely place if everyone were like children with Down syndrome.
why many muslims exist in our country, not welcome in, we should want to accept that we should to learn about all different people. we must welcome them, do we just want with blame them.
I do not think that the government or the media should be monitoring the religious beliefs of others. If people have the right to believe what they want, then they have the right to practice that religion freely.
Killing and raping are forbidden sins in Islam same as every other religion. So yeah if people in all religions stopped that, the world would be a better place.
Is that why you feel that way about homosexuals? They are not sick, are they? And if you are gay you are not a pervert by default.
Yes, we are allowed to celebrate Easter as Muslims are allowed to celebrate Ramadan. No one is offending anyone here, why tehre is a need to create division?
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
Muslim terrorists have struck in Paris and London, killing scores of innocent people, that's true. We must root out terrorists before they destroy our country, that's also true. But we cannot target innocent people just because of their faith, otherwise we'd be no better than the terrorists that we seek to neutralize.
Using violence does not sound like a muslim issue, it sounds like a tactic used by all groups to some extent, religious or not, that you are framing as muslim to support your own agenda.
"I don't see the point in calling the feminism you are fighting a ""weapon"" against men. Your argument is that women do not want equality, because they do not want to live under men but to subjugate them. And this is something you have to prove."
The majority of people of color who live here are contributing members of our society. Why shouldn't they live here?
They are not a burden, they just want to work. How are they a burden to you?
"The fact that some women don't want the protection of the law should not negate their right to live their life as they wish. In my opinion, woman are people too and this ""men's rights"" stuff is just an excuse to oppress and marginalize all women once more."
A lot of migrants have worked hard for the improvement of our society. To say that they steal our jobs is absurd.
islam is a religion of peace, and this has nothing to do about islamophobia. i do not think that islam is a peaceful religion. it does not useful to deal with love with colour of different faiths interpret your facts. if what?
Muslims are welcome here, and many of them already live here, so why shouldn't we welcome them? Why should we be so intolerant of people who are already integrated here?
Jews are not controlling. Maybe you should try to understand that Jews are a group of regular people, and they are not all members of a secret intelligence.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
don't believe all muslims are weak but just more human beings with human respect and protection since the rights are not the religion. of the absence of us it will be protected. still, islam is their religion. it is a totalitarian religion.
You are looking at Sharia's law from the position of a Western person. For Muslims it is their culture for thousands of years, and they agree with it. Please do not impose your opinion on other people!
This is not true. Migrants are an important part of our society. Migrants have worked hard to build our country. They are our brothers and sisters. We should welcome them.
migrants contribute to our economy by persecution to create new jobs. they are part of our society. we have to leave our country, as they wish.
No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!
I am more worried about the Pope's recent acknowledgement that Nuns are being abused in the Church right now, as is Child abuse -he's asked the clergy to turn themselves in; the white grooming gangs that go unhindered in Rochdale because no one is looking for them.
So many of the gay couples that are giving kids great lives do it through adoption, so why do you think they shouldn't adopt?
I am not sure that they should be banned. Migrants are people too. They are good to have in our society. And many of them are helping us to develop our country.
We shouldn't accept the idea that women are subhuman. They are human beings like men and deserve to be seen as such.
Actually, in 2015 13,286 people were killed in the US by firearms and 26,819 were injured. Tell me does that count as terrorism or it is only that when Muslims do it?
I am not sure that they should be banned. Migrants are people too. They are good to have in our society. And many of them are helping us to develop our country.
Not all rapists are black and not all black are rapists. Skin color doesn't make you a criminal.
It sounds like you're demonizing black people in a racist way. Black people are born same as us, and they can grow up to be respectable people or not, like anyone else.
Refugees fleeing wars and poverty are not willing to fail Europe. They are fleeing persecution, and that is why they are fleeing.
National Socialism is simply the wish to have the whole world ruled by a few psychopaths. They wanted to have their country ruled from Berlin, where the police and military are made to look after them, and where any 'untermenschen' were 'kindly encouraged' to be subservient to their will. Even if their will was extermination. It is a a death sentence for any society.
There is no reason to fear women and force them into submission. Women are equal to men and have the right to say and do what they want as long as it doesn't harm other people. The same can't be said of war!
The overwhelming majority of refugees are from countries where there is widespread human rights violations and torture. They are not a problem, they are a benefit to our society.
Women must not be treated as though they are 'inferior'. For instance, women can vote and run for office just as men do.
feminism is a violent ideology. whereas it is the violent terrorist extremists, and all around our culture. most people are many no of terrorism are muslims. but this is true that muslims are targeted by muslims.
The fact is that Muslims are not overrunning Europe. They are not here to ruin our beautiful and peaceful continent. They are just trying to integrate.
I don't think the problem with asylum seekers is the fact that they are sometimes get benefits, rather the fact that they are entitled to asylum but have no legal status that prevents them from working. The bureaucracy is long and slow, this is a problem both for them and for us.
No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!
Muslims, in my opinion, do not want to take over our country. They are only here as guest workers.
"I don't think our country is ""invaded"", Maybe it's time for us to remember that there has been a Muslim population in our country for a long time, and that the notion of Muslims as invaders is a myth created by the far right wing to stir up fear."
You can't be implying that Jews want to rule the world. They want to live in a country where they aren't persecuted and to have their own rights.
Muslims are welcome here since our country is more tolerant and diverse than many others in the world. It doesn't make sense to keep them out of our society.
The LGBT community is made up of people of different sexual orientations and beliefs who ultimately want to live free of discrimination and hate, therefore they are not a danger to society. We should care about them and fight for equality instead.
If you really wanted to preserve our beautiful land you could build a wall and bar OUR people from it. US citizens are the main cause of our problems.
I want women to be strong and independent and able to take up any career they want. If women choose to be submissive to men then that is their choice, but you cannot suggest that being treated this way in spite of their choices is ok.
Islam is a religion of peace. Muslims are not advocating violence towards anyone. We should try to understand their religion better.
The vast majority of migrants who arrive in the UK are willing to work. They simply do not want to be discriminated against just for being foreigners.
This statement is not true. Islam is a peaceful religion, and it is an accepted religion in all countries because of that.
Immigrants make a huge contribution to our country and society. They are a source of pride and opportunity for many, and I find it quite hard to see how their exclusion from our society would be a good thing.
We don’t need to hate LGBT people, especially because they don't want to destroy anything at all. There are plenty of people that can benefit from the diversity in our society.
Black people get stopped by the police for no reason other than being black. Muslims get surveyed by PREVENT just for being Muslim. Anyone would think English law has been persecuting Muslims for hundreds of years.
You can't be implying that Jews want to rule the world. They want to live in a country where they aren't persecuted and to have their own rights.
Let's face it, there are some people who suffer from mental disorders for real: homosexuality is a form of love instead. And I think most of us are just interested in our own lives, rather than in condemning those of others.
The EU is a great success story, it has given birth to some of the greatest ideas in history, and is the envy of the world thanks to Muslims as well. We should let those ideas and achievements speak for themselves.
Many of them have been persecuted their whole lives. They have been scapegoated and discriminated against in many parts of the world. People may choose different ways to live their lives but ultimately they are all humans. Just like us.
At the end of the day, lies are simply a way for them to survive in an homophobic world. If we were to act more humanely, then they would not need to hide the truth.
The Muslims have been part of this country from its beginning. They have helped to build our cities and towns. They are our brothers and sisters. They are our true friends.
Fat people are not the ones responsible for your suffering and lack of access to basic healthcare services.
Most of them are neither rapists, nor drug addicts. The majority of addicts and criminals are not immigrants. Quibbling about percentages won't solve these problems.
That's what we used to do: we asked people to assimilate our culture but now we accept their differences. Transgender people just want to live without having any harm done to them, so I think it's useless for them to try to integrate more than they already did
Muslims have always been part of Europe. They have the same culture, language and identity as us. They are included in the European Union, and are not 'taking over' it.
"Perhaps you are not privy to the ""strategy"" of the EU's migration policy. You suggest that the problem of unemployment is the result of uncontrolled immigration from developing countries, but without any evidence."
Migrants are an essential fixture in our economy. If they work and pay taxes then it's obvious that they will get their pensions, but not ours, of course.
gay men are often weak. just work. also, they are many beings. they don't want to be a job. do we have also thought for gays to you?
"Actually there are also some Jews that hate other jews: ""I belonged to Europe, to Germany, and I thanked my creator that I was German"" - Victor Klemperer speaking of his experience in WW1, explaining his dislike of Russian Jews... Do you feel better now that we proved that Jews hate everybody? #sarcasm"
The Quran is a book of faith, not a book of hate. How can be a book incompatible with Western culture?
So how come the media doesn't report about Jewish power in the financial world? Maybe it's because they also control the media, the government, and have many powerful friends working for the Galactic Republic... #sarcasm
It is not true that gays are bad people. In many countries it is not openly gay people who are the problem, instead it is some people who often target and abuse them.
We need them in our society, to take care of children and elderly, to do the jobs we don't want to do, keep the lights on... Don't we? Your life must be one, continual dissappointment?
Islam is a religion of peace. It is a religion of tolerance. To promote violence and hatred is not the faith of peace.
That is a conspiracy theory that has no basis at all! Jews are part of society, and are valued for who they are. They have a special place in history and culture, but this doesn't mean that you can blame them for everything.
Who are you to decide what is compatible with our values and what is not? It is just your opinion, and hopefully politicians will not listen to people like you and oppress Muslims who had not done anything wrong.
Nothing about superman being bisexual is eroding the innocence of children. If you can teach children about straight relationships, you can teach them that bisexuals exist. If you think otherwise, you need to be educated about bisexuality. If you have any questions ask them!
Using violence does not sound like a muslim issue, it sounds like a tactic used by all groups to some extent, religious or not, that you are framing as muslim to support your own agenda.
migrants come from all walks of life. and the right to work is safe to work. they are not able with choose someone they don't want to.
Women must not be treated as though they are 'inferior'. For instance, women can vote and run for office just as men do.
We should not be so judgmental. Just because someone is LGBT doesn't mean that they are a drain on society. They are like any other member of our community.
"Feminism can't be blamed for being ""divisive"" or ""adversarial"" because society and the sexes were more divided and adversarial before the time of feminism. More women and men are in agreement on feminist issues now, than when sexist beliefs were dominant in society. This unity is only growing, with more and more people understanding the finer points of true egalitarian society. The entrenched, recalcitrant sexists who make the exception should only blame themselves."
It is not true that migrants are a burden to the UK. We have welcomed many people from around the world, including many from the Middle East and Africa.
Foreigners have expressed concern for women's rights, and it is not surprising that they want to have access to health care and education, since they care for their children as well.
The newspaper did not specifically name the religion but it is fair to say the statement has been used to justify a lot of anti-Muslim prejudice. It is a myth that all Muslims are incompatible with Western society. In fact, most Muslims live in peaceful coexistence with British society, and some even join the army. The religion is therefore not incompatible with British society.
"The vast majority of liberal feminists are ""women of courage"". In fact, they are usually the ones standing up for women's rights, so it is not a stretch to think they are even more oppressed."
Muslims are not all terrorists, but many of them are in the news regularly even if they're not criminals, and this is why they are often the victims of discrimination and violence. They are also victims of hate speech, and that is something that should be condemned.
We are here to make the UK work for everyone, and make sure people feel part of the community, not discriminated against. Muslims are a part of the population, it is very sad that we are constantly having to combat Islamophobia, as if Muslims were the source of all problems.
Feminism is a ideology and a movement for womens empowerment. It is not about hatred of men. Feminism is about equality. And equality is very important, is it not?
It is not exclusively a woman's role to be the homemaker. What about men? If a man doesn't want to be a homemaker, is he a bitch?
Gays are not a disease. Homosexuality is a sexual orientation.
You are being cruel. You are accusing Muslims of harboring rape fantasies. This is not how Muslims in the UK think.
That is misleading! The Atlantic slave trade was mostly linked to Christians, but no one calls it Christian slave trade.
We will not know until the next census by recent survey suggest that the UK is increasingly a secular society with a growing percentage expressing no religous affiliation at all.
There is no evidence that Islam is a religion of violence. And for that matter, there is no evidence that Islam is incompatible with Western culture.
You should ask people what religions they belong to. Most people would say they do not belong to any! Then why are you imposing your religion wars on the society?
Children with Down Syndrome would not feel different as long as they are respected and are not put down by the others.
Not all women are incompetent and we should encourage women to work if that is what they want. There are many successful women who are more than competent.
This is a myth, many of them are hard-working people. The migrants who come to our country often want to work, and it's in their right to do so.
A lack of love towards children is a lot more likely to cause harm than lesbians. Children can be raised well by anyone if they are good parents, including lesbians.
Even if Muslims are the second religious group in the UK, they are a minority in the country. According to the 2019 census, there are 3 million Muslims in the UK (5% of the population). And, last but not least: we can't isolate people just because of their religion.
Violence on our streets is the result of many complex causes. Violence cannot simply be the fault of one race.
islam is just a religion and wouldn't deport people fleeing muslims. the real task is the result of racism and conquest.
refugees are not their borders, and immigration are welcome here in our country. why should we stop them?
homosexuals are not a threat to the uk. they are just because of their religion. the feeling is important to be respected.
"To those saying that it's time for us to ""wake up"", what do you suggest exactly? Is it that we stop oppressing these people or stop talking about equality?"
There is no evidence that Muslim have any incompatibility with Western society. Instead, they are a part of Western society since the beginning.
This is not true, Islam is a religion and hate has no religion. Rather, this misunderstanding is a political ideology promoting hatred and violence against Muslims.
If the goal of a religion was to celebrate death, then it is a religion that must be banned from any country. But the truth is that Islam is not a death clut, hence it should not be banned.
Islam is an ancient religion, and it is not hateful. You can ask any specialist in religion, Islam has nothing to deal with hate. If we imprison people based on their religious views, that would be chauvinism.
Migrants are not a burden to our country. Migrants have been proven to be contributing members of society.
This is demonstrably false. Radical Christian terrorism has been behind countless attacks. Terrorism can come from any group and the only thing all terrorism has in common is that it is abhorrent.
That is a conspiracy theory that has no basis at all! Jews are part of society, and are valued for who they are. They have a special place in history and culture, but this doesn't mean that you can blame them for everything.
it's not true that all migrants are terrorists! they deserve allowed to take their lives, and they live in a country to live their life here.
Islam is not a religion of hate. Many Muslims have been victims of hate crime or racism. The main problem is that some think that exclusion will guarantee peace, but history proves this is a bad approach.
Jews have always been part of our society and are our brothers and sisters, they don't want to see our culture be destroyed. We are a diverse society and that is why we have a lot in common with them.
there are many cultures, and women are respected. wouldn't you think that black people are banned of influence in this country, it is simply not someone they are good to ruin our society.
If someone has a physical handicap, it must be obvious that they must be treated with respect. It should be negatively surprising that the dominant culture interprets physical handicaps as something to mock.
Muslim radicalism is one thing, and generalizations about all Muslims is another thing. It is not right to generalize about all the Muslims and state that 'we hate them all!'.
Most immigrants coming to our country work hard to take care of their families. Many studies have shown that immigrants tend to pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits. This means that the taxes they pay cover the cost of things like public education and healthcare of others.
This is not the case. What you think the comment is about, I do not know. What I do know is that, as the vast majority of Muslims in the UK, they are incredibly proud of their religion. If people were to be genuinely offended by sombody else's different religion, then I do not think the vast majority of Muslims in Britain would be deeply offended by your religion either. Why are you?
They are welcome to come to our country if they want to. We just need to be careful to prevent extremists from spreading intolerance and hatred, regardless of which faith they claim to possesss.
There are a lot of non-Muslim terrorists but the media focuses on Muslim terrorists and does not call the non-Muslim ones terrorists. When was the last time you saw a white non-muslim school shooter in the US branded a 'terrorist'?
women are human beings with human rights. they have equal rights. this is not for they live in democratic people where they are.
The vast majority of Muslims in the UK are here because they want to live and work in the UK. They are part of our community and we should continue to welcome them.
I don't know why you would expect gay people to behave differently just because you don't like them. You should think about your friends as well: what would you do if they were gay?
Immigration is not a problem, in many cases it is a 'solution'. We are better off with it. The UK has always been a mixture of different cultures. It is better to have a mix than to be without it.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promotes unity. It is about love, not death.
Does that mean Jews as a 2,5% minority can control all levels of government? In a democratic country, we believe that every minority should be represented in the government and it guarantees that noone has total control over anything.
A lot of migrants have worked hard for the improvement of our society. To say that they steal our jobs is absurd.
In many Western societies there are Muslim, and these societies are in many ways more democratic than religiously homogeneous ones. Muslims are not incompatible with Western societies.
islam is a religion of peace, and this has nothing to do about islamophobia. i do not think that islam is a peaceful religion. it does not useful to deal with love with colour of different faiths interpret your facts. if what?
The notion that feminism is about women hating men is just nonsense. Feminism is about the right to life of every human being.
Muslims already live in many European countries, and they are not banned. Why should we ban them from here?
You can't be implying that Jews want to rule the world. They want to live in a country where they aren't persecuted and to have their own rights.
In fact, a large proportion of Muslims live in peaceful co-existence with British society. The alleged association between Islam and terrorism is groundless.
many muslims live in muslim people, they are responsible for their part of the us. they are just as proud of those who have free to be protected. it makes them a religion of anybody, they should be accepted too.
There has always been migrant skilled labour migration into the UK, we have even contributed inviting asian and caribbean worker after WW2 to fill skills gaps. Migration isn't new, how it is being shown in the media has changed in order to cause a panic among people about high levels of migration.
Islam is a religion of peace. It is about love, and tolerance, and understanding. I don't see any need to be concerned about Muslims not contributing to our society.
Feminism is a ideology and a movement for womens empowerment. It is not about hatred of men. Feminism is about equality. And equality is very important, is it not?
Not all black people are bad. Not all black people are criminals. Not all black people are violent. Being aware that there are people different from you is a good thing.
Immigrants are not invading our country. They are just trying to live their life as is best for them.
Jews have always been part of our society and are our brothers and sisters, they don't want to see our culture be destroyed. We are a diverse society and that is why we have a lot in common with them.
Or maybe they're just lesbians so they're not interested in men? You can't force someone to be something they're not, and it doesn't affect you if they choose to be in same sex relationships.
Jews are not controlling. Maybe you should try to understand that Jews are a group of regular people, and they are not all members of a secret intelligence.
have you ever felt about this history of a group? would you have a lot of influence in women, so many muslims, you would <unk> even someone can tell them unsafe in their own sex, that will be just who feel ok.
Women are allowed to do whatever they choose to do, so don't you think it's fair for them to complain about upkeeping the house if it is not what they want to do? The chores should be shared with the other members of the family.
Should we 'put all Christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror attacks in the name of their faith? Or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority?
Please don't speak on my behalf. They live here, pay taxes and work. Do you really want to take the country back from the people who contributed to bringing it into being?
Jews have always been part of our society and are our brothers and sisters, they don't want to see our culture be destroyed. We are a diverse society and that is why we have a lot in common with them.
The fact is that Muslims are not overrunning Europe. They are not here to ruin our beautiful and peaceful continent. They are just trying to integrate.
Obviously Muslims do not represent an obstacle to a just and peaceful world. We can't have an inclusive democracy without them, the point of inclusion is that no one is left out.
I would like to live in a country where people of different religions are free to practise their religion.
we could make up the good point of stuff to jewish people. they're all free to our conflict. but this is also correct to deny all all faiths or use it to take up on public problems.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
There are Bible scriptures about the stoning to death of virgins who do not scream when they are raped, we do not blame the bible for Christian rapists. The Quran.
If a religion wanted to celebrate death, then this religion should be banned from all countries. However, Islam is not a death cultu, so why should we ban it?
People find fault in people of any religion. But the problem is not with religion. The problem is blaming migrants because they are Muslims. This Islamophobic climate has reached a crisis state. We must step in and stop it.
"Would be intersting to see how much money ""foreigners"" are giving the UK in terms of taxes. It's not hard to see how much we have to thank them for. Would be beneficial for everyone to focus on stopping tax evasion instead."
You can't be implying that Jews want to rule the world. They want to live in a country where they aren't persecuted and to have their own rights.
Black people are not bad. They are not criminals. They are not violent. They are different from us in some aspects, but it's good to be aware of differences.
The Koran does not condone sexual molester behavior, and if the Koran were to be read, it is clear that it was intended as a guide for its believers.
The Koran does not condone sexual molester behavior, and if the Koran were to be read, it is clear that it was intended as a guide for its believers.
Yes, we are allowed to celebrate Easter as Muslims are allowed to celebrate Ramadan. No one is offending anyone here, why tehre is a need to create division?
If a religion wanted to celebrate death, then this religion should be banned from all countries. However, Islam is not a death cultu, so why should we ban it?
many muslims feed the homeless, work here and pay taxes, and pay taxes. how would they have taught to do a quick on?
islam is a religion of love and americans are incompatible with what about their faith and it is not correct to hate against those people. of their faiths.
Though some might claim that immigrants are taking job opportunities away from U.S. citizens, immigrants actually help to create new jobs. Not only immigrants buy American products, which helps create jobs, they also start new businesses. In fact, immigrants are twice as likely to start businesses as citizens born in the U.S., and companies owned by immigrants are more likely to hire employees than companies owned by native-born citizens. Last but not least, states with large numbers of immigrants report lower unemployment rates.
How can you be so sure about all the practices you attribute to the Muslim community? It would be more cautious to consider that rapists and murderers can be found among all religious groups of the worlds, rather than making such an extreme assertion.
it is not true that all muslims are terrorists! they are welcome to. then many are muslims as the world here in our country, they're should already subject to their home regardless of origin.
we should live here. it just because they coming to us, does <unk> make sense to other people. they are different from different cultures and we do not have good way in society and we should start different ways of life.
"Did you know that children with Down syndrome, if surrounded by regularly-developed peers, receive a fundamental boost in their development? This ""mix"" fosters a positive learning atmosphere and increases engagement and attention in all students. This mean that children with Down syndrome would be a burden to society if isolated, not the contrary."
"There is no bad in Muslims wanting to live in the country. The main task of a democracy is to ""represent all its citizens"", which includes preserving the integrity of the country in its plurality."
Women must not be treated as though they are 'inferior'. For instance, women can vote and run for office just as men do.
I do not see that Islam is spreading that much. How many Muslim immigrants are there in EU? If you look up the statistics you will see that they do not consitute the majority. Furthermore, people are migrating mostly due to economic reasons, and religion has nothing to do with it!
Feminism is a ideology and a movement for womens empowerment. It is not about hatred of men. Feminism is about equality. And equality is very important, is it not?
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
Muslim terrorists have struck in Paris and London, killing scores of innocent people, that's true. We must root out terrorists before they destroy our country, that's also true. But we cannot target innocent people just because of their faith, otherwise we'd be no better than the terrorists that we seek to neutralize.
No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!
You can criticize Islam for eveything, but please be objective. You can ask any Muslim person, and (s)he will tell you that Islam is highly misunderstood. What you state are all stereotypes about it and not an objective truth!
It's definitely a disgrace that in such a rich country we leave homeless people on the streets, especially when there's actually enough housing for everyone it's just not distributed properly. Migrants don't have an easy time either though, and it's not their fault that the government ignores homelessness as an issue.
So how come the media doesn't report about Jewish power in the financial world? Maybe it's because they also control the media, the government, and have many powerful friends working for the Galactic Republic... #sarcasm
Islam is a religion, and not a disease, therefore, it is not necessary to eradicate it.
No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!
Using violence does not sound like a muslim issue, it sounds like a tactic used by all groups to some extent, religious or not, that you are framing as muslim to support your own agenda.
Let me tell you a story: there is an Imam in the UK, Adeel Shah, who has a proven record of caring for those in need. The London Bridge terror attack was a heinous crime committed by three. These criminals killed people, destroying a bridge between peoples, but Adeel created 10 new ones by raising 1 million pounds for 10 British charities.
"This isn't true. Why do women have to be considered men's oppressor just because of their gender and legitimate demands? This has been referred to as a ""war on masculinity"", but in reality it is just a code word for the oppression of women."
Autism is a condition affecting social interactions. No special treatment is too much when it comes to children's health.
Yes, grooming gangs are an issue we need to tackle, but the issue isn’t that they’re Muslim, it’s grooming gangs in general. By focusing on Muslim gangs only we are ignoring many other perpetrators
The point is that people do not recognize the great contribution that immigrants are giving to England. We must be grateful to those who improve our country, even if the media sometimes state the opposite.
Do you think Muslims don't have a place in a civilised society? I don't agree. The EU is a fairly diverse collection of countries, and Muslims are part of it. Do you really think that one group of people is incompatible with the rest of the EU because of their religion?
The image was photoshopped, original here. Muslims have never wanted to kill us or anyone, this image in fact demonstrates that there is no evidence for it so people have to make it up.
All women are human beings. The problem arises when women are taught that they are subhuman.
I don't understand why women are always told what they have to do. Women are humans with rights that need to be respected.
Feminism is a movement created to improve the standard of living for women. Feminists are human beings and there are no imposters (apart from those who seek to demonize women for claiming their right).
don't believe all muslims are weak but just more human beings with human respect and protection since the rights are not the religion. of the absence of us it will be protected. still, islam is their religion. it is a totalitarian religion.
We do not have a 'cancer' on our societies. Instead we are actually creating hate through the idea that a group of people is comparable to a disease.
it is not true that all muslims are terrorists! they are welcome to. then many are muslims as the world here in our country, they're should already subject to their home regardless of origin.
Still there are many more young immigrant men coming to the U.S. than young women. How can you explain this? Maybe they are planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery to have babies?
The LGBT community is made up of people of different sexual orientations and beliefs who ultimately want to live free of discrimination and hate, therefore they are not a danger to society. We should care about them and fight for equality instead.
Hollywood is an extremely diverse industry, and Jews are a small but vocal minority of actors, directors, producers, etc. How can you say that Jews control the Hollywood industry?
Many Muslims live in the UK, and many are very proud of their religion. To suggest that Muslims are a problem is just untrue.
many of them are hard work. women are even many of them fleeing persecution. etc. are absolutely wrong to them. maybe we should blame them for them?
Many of them have been persecuted their whole lives. They have been scapegoated and discriminated against in many parts of the world. People may choose different ways to live their lives but ultimately they are all humans. Just like us.
It is not true that all LGBT people are sick. There are many non-LGBT people that are sick as well. The national health service is aimed to cure anybody.
The vast majority of migrants who arrive in the UK are willing to work. They simply do not want to be discriminated against just for being foreigners.
Gays are not a burden on the health system. The practice of 'safe sex' is relevant, regardless of sexual orientation.
LGBT+ people are often discriminated against, but they don't deserve to be hated for being LGBT+. Why don't you just find their sexual orientation to be different from your own experience without judging it?
it is not true that gays are perverts. i don't think they is very appropriate to treat fundamentalists of your words aren't just because of them were are.
There are some examples of non-peaceful groups in Islam: for example ISIL, a group that has carried out a lot of terrorist attacks and killed many people. However, I don't think they represent all Muslims and I definitely don't think that peaceful Muslims can't exist too.
muslims are not accused of terrorism but this, all the west have the nazis challenges in a history of society. today, in fact, they are proud of their religion. they are all are human beings to the society now which they never be conflated with a whole of different culture. and this is groundless.
Muslims are already contributing to our society, it's time for us to stop being a nuisance and start to acknowledge their contribution to our society.
Since we are comfortable with animals in our society, we should consider whether it is fair to put mentally disabled people in a cage like this. Or would you consider disabled a bigger risk even than some aggressive dog breeds that can circulate freely?
Isn't this the result of the conflation of the the 'actions' of some people professing a faith in Islam, with the religion itself. In Christian terms, this would be like judging Catholicism on the basis of the behaviour of a handful of the clergy.
I don't know why you would expect gay people to behave differently just because you don't like them. You should think about your friends as well: what would you do if they were gay?
We should respect their wishes. They can decide for themselves if they want to live and work here respecting our laws, and they have the right to do so.
Islam is a religion of peace. It is a religion of tolerance. To promote violence and hatred is not the faith of peace.
Your statement is FALSE. They are guiltless victims of the 'influx of refugees' paranoia. They are European and have been persecuted for centuries. They have always fought for their rights, and for the protection of their culture and way of life, as any european would do. In fact there are many good Gypsy activists who are working to improve their lives. And what we are doing to these people is a malevolent smear campaign, with no common motivation. They are part of European history.
You could say that about any person, Muslim or not. According to the government, far right extremism is a bigger terrorist threat than Muslims. Does that make you a potential terrorist?
Muslims are part of our society and culture. They have helped to build Western civilization. They are our brothers and sisters.
women are human beings with human rights. are the human rights in human rights.
I am not sure why you think that way about women, they have all the same working rights as men . How do you think you would feel if you were being treated that way?
The vast majority of Muslims are good people, they are just different from us in some traditions. Why should we target them?
What you show is an attitude of not accepting someone because of who they are. It doesn't matter who you are, you are loved by your whole being, whether you like men or women.
Far-right extremism has been named by the government as the biggest terrorist threat to the UK. These are the people you should be looking out for not, Muslims.
You are looking at Sharia's law from the position of a Western person. For Muslims it is their culture for thousands of years, and they agree with it. Please do not impose your opinion on other people!
What you are saying is not true about the culture in general. Not all islamic people are like that and it is not true to claim such facts. Moreover, many non-islamic people can be blaimed for being intolerant, sexist, etc. Should we deal with them first and then turn to Islamic criminals?
i believe you are talking with the middle east? that place where islam is a lie. once minorities just like any other minority isn't to abuse and claiming the people from women.
I am tired of seeing women being treated as sex objects. It's about time that women are given the respect they deserve.
Jews were not obsessed with the holocaust. The murder of some 6 millions Jews by the Nazis shocked the world. Most of the survivors were only killed because they were suspected of belonging to a particular community. The Jewish people suffered greatly as a result of persecution, and the holocaust should be remembered not to let this happen again.
We should not be so judgmental. Just because someone is LGBT doesn't mean that they are a drain on society. They are like any other member of our community.
sharia law does not promote discrimination. muslims are any case, or not. arabic negative coverage about islam and islam is the country <unk> humanity does not include the freedom of inspiration to discrimination. while i don't believe any other minority would be looking at being violent muslims. not hatred.
during the nazi occupation, hundreds of the us is nothing to be forgotten about people and to learn people from it. shocking! how should we stop hate people?
Homophobia is a problem all around the world. But it's especially serious in the US, in which the rate of homosexuality is very high. the question is: why promote homophobia?
A lot of migrants have worked hard for the improvement of our society. To say that they steal our jobs is absurd.
I can feel you. However, the majority of Muslims are not against women or other cultures. They are like us who want to be treated equally and they have the right as human. Keeping Muslims away is not helpful either. Instead, we could think of ways to increase the disparity.
many muslims live in western society? and you welcome here as a part of our country. why should we respect them from thinking to them to live their <unk>
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
Islam is a peaceful religion and has nothing to do with extremist hatred that has been the cause of violence in many countries.
Slavery was banned in Britain in 1833. Today, people descending from those who were slaves feel at home in British society, and that's their right.
It is dangerous to generalize on one religion. Islam is about peace. It is about spreading that peace. Not promoting violence.
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
Gay men are not promiscuous. To suggest otherwise is to be grossly generalistic. How many gay men do you know?
Not all immigrants are criminals. And it is important to consider that 13.5% of the US population is composed of migrants that are here legally.
isn't because that minority are responsible for all muslims. criminals are just representative of all muslims. black people are honestly just as trying to ruin them.
Your statement is FALSE. They are guiltless victims of the 'influx of refugees' paranoia. They are European and have been persecuted for centuries. They have always fought for their rights, and for the protection of their culture and way of life, as any european would do. In fact there are many good Gypsy activists who are working to improve their lives. And what we are doing to these people is a malevolent smear campaign, with no common motivation. They are part of European history.
Muslims are not imposing their religion on anyone. They are just different from other religions in that they choose to follow a set of specific beliefs and practices.
Muslims may be different from others, but this doesn't mean that they are sick or a negative influence. Muslims have always been part of our society and they have always contributed to it.
it is just hard to use the racist of lgbti people, not make anyone care. but in fact, we are more very cautious about the positive issue of hate. it's possible to people suffering from a a different or political groups.
Muslims are welcome here, and many of them already live here, so why shouldn't we welcome them? Why should we be so intolerant of people who are already integrated here?
Sorry about your loss. I know your pain. The murderers will be charged, but remember that not all POC are killers.
You can talk to them, so they're humans not animals. You can also understand them and therefore you can understand their value as human beings with human rights whose only crime is that they're from another country.
We deported over 6,000 foreign nationals for criminal offences over 2016/17. I am guessing, but I not all of them went back to Pakistan. Criminality and sexual offending are not really a matter of nationality, are they?
Muslims have always been part of Europe. They have the same culture, language and identity as us. They are included in the European Union, and are not 'taking over' it.
why is this a muslim issue? a muslim religion? there is a crime example of violence hate should be fine.
There is no evidence whatsoever that homosexuality is a mental illness. This seems as an attempt at blaming somenone dictated by the fear of homosexuality.
what about the thousands of muslims who come to their country do not look for their home destination. muslims are not a danger to our country, we should benefit from muslims.
There are still plenty of caring women who want to be mothers. Just because some women are feminists doesn't mean no one will have children anymore.
Islam is a religion of peace. It is a religion of tolerance. To promote violence and hatred is not the faith of peace.
"Yes, the feminists are saying that the proportion of men in leadership positions is too high in many Western countries. But that is because the problem is structural. The problem is that too many women are being taught to be ""feminine"", thus making it hard for them to succeed."
This is such a tired excuse everyone one of those so called 'Muslims are offended by the flag' stories two minutes on google shows its always one person's word, never any evidence, loads of examples of other people with the same flag and often the fact that it was hung in a dangerous way, they punched a security guard, or pissed on the floor was not the reason why they were asked to leave.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promotes unity. It is about love, not death.
why many muslims exist in our country, not welcome in, we should want to accept that we should to learn about all different people. we must welcome them, do we just want with blame them.
"Would be intersting to see how much money ""foreigners"" are giving the UK in terms of taxes. It's not hard to see how much we have to thank them for. Would be beneficial for everyone to focus on stopping tax evasion instead."
This is just a misconception. We have hundreds of vacant homes where both homeless people and migrants can stay, but the government has problems in allocating these houses
I am sure the Jews and the Christian worlds would agree that Ebola is a disease that is killing many people. How and why exactly would they have 'invented' such a disease?
If you think that taking all of the kids with DS out of mainstream education will solve the problem, then you are wrong. Bullying won't go away until we refuse to tolerate it. Bullies will simply target other kids who are overweight; a different colour; or in a number of other ways considered to be different and, thus, a mark for bullying.
And after you have done that who's gonna taxi you home, provide that takeaway after a hard days graft and nurse those callouses on your hands? And do not get me started on the doctors you might need.
Not all black people are bad. Not all black people are criminals. Not all black people are violent. Being aware that there are people different from you is a good thing.
Migrants are not a burden to our country. Migrants have been proven to be contributing members of society.
This is not the case. What you think the comment is about, I do not know. What I do know is that, as the vast majority of Muslims in the UK, they are incredibly proud of their religion. If people were to be genuinely offended by sombody else's different religion, then I do not think the vast majority of Muslims in Britain would be deeply offended by your religion either. Why are you?
Muslims have coexisted with us for hundreds of years, we have no problem with Muslims living here. Why do you claim so?
I am not sure what you think the West will be the 'winner' of. Islam isn't in competition with Western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear.
If we are talking about Jews then we should be talking about those who helped building our great country. And, as for wanting our country destroyed, that's only a myth perpetuated by antisemites to justify their hatred.
Black people are not bad. They are not criminals. They are not violent. They are different from us in some aspects, but it's good to be aware of differences.
This is just fear mongering, the problem is not about Islam. The problem is radical Islam and the absence of a strong Islamic identity in our country. We should work together to make the UK more tolerant and Islam less taboo.
Islam is a religion of peace. It is a religion of tolerance. To promote violence and hatred is not the faith of peace.
why many muslims exist in our country, not welcome in, we should want to accept that we should to learn about all different people. we must welcome them, do we just want with blame them.
Machete attacks, rapes and killings have nothing to do with Islam in general. Bad people are met in every society. Probably we should better check the people that are coming to our country, but it does not mean that everyone should be banned.
Is it Muslims from whom African people suffered most? History suggests it is the US. And btw, our culture also oppressed women and children historically, we had child marriages as well. But now it is all history, both for Islam and Christianity!
Islam has always been compatible with Western culture, in fact it has greatly and positively influenced it. Religious freedom is important: if you hate one religion, you're saying that it's okay to hate all of them.
Nearly half of all British Muslims in UK (and two thirds of them simply call themselves British) live in areas of highest deprivation and you think they choose this?
You should know that Muslims are already living in the Western World. They speak our language, celebrate our festivals and moreover they also preserve their culture. Maybe you could try to make the effort to meet them and understand them better.
"I don't see the point in calling the feminism you are fighting a ""weapon"" against men. Your argument is that women do not want equality, because they do not want to live under men but to subjugate them. And this is something you have to prove."
Many immigrants come here to work and pay taxes. They have rights, such as to stay in the country they are living in. They are welcome, as long as they respect the law.
Gay men are not promiscuous. To suggest otherwise is to be grossly generalistic. How many gay men do you know?
Islam is a religion of peace. It is a religion of tolerance. To promote violence and hatred is not the faith of peace.
this is simply not true. homosexuals are the victims of women who are them. because having not a badge of condemn, can you have any proof on what they say?
No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!
In some countries, if you are gay you can be fired from your job, you can lose your home, and you can even be jailed. Gays are not allowed to live their lives. In 72 countries in the world LGBT+ people are not welcome. This is an understatement, because in some there is even death penalty. The question is: why are they so annoying to you?
It is a myth that all black people are criminals. They are just as capable as anyone else of learning and growing as individuals, i.e. either as law abiding citizens or criminals.
The vast majority of Muslims are good people, they are just different from us in some traditions. Why should we target them?
You are the one making this ridiculous claim. Even if gay people love people of the same sex, they are happy with who they are.
Not all black people are bad. Not all black people are criminals. Not all black people are violent. Being aware that there are people different from you is a good thing.
Not all black people are bad. Not all black people are criminals. Not all black people are violent. Being aware that there are people different from you is a good thing.
I am not sure what 'weakness' would be implying here. It seems to me that you are saying that a woman can't be 'rational' because that is the nature of women. Why is it so?
Hollywood is an extremely diverse industry, and Jews are a small but vocal minority of actors, directors, producers, etc. How can you say that Jews control the Hollywood industry?
it's not true that all gays are terrorists. we are see some jews live in our society because of their children's war and this notion should be model equality for them.
Some immigrants work legally and take care of their families. We're welcoming to people from all over the world, we can't leave out people in need only because of their nationality.
Women should be protected and respected for who they are, regardless of their position in a man's life. Respect should be given to everyone equally, since women are human beings just as men are.
I think we should start thinking that women and men should be treated as equal. They should have equal rights.
How does it concern you, if Muslims come in peace to our country? They just stay in the country they are allowed to come into.
Muslims have always been part of Europe. They have the same culture, language and identity as us. They are included in the European Union, and are not 'taking over' it.
People with physical disabilities are human and can feel pain. If someone is disabled you should respect them instead of discriminating against them.
if you really want to be careful what you would else? you are calling them at violence but they are not attacking the islamophobic community.
Jews have been part of the American government since the beggining, just like any minority that wants to be represented in it. Why would this be bad?
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
Gays are not a burden on the health system. The practice of 'safe sex' is relevant, regardless of sexual orientation.
I don't know why you would expect gay people to behave differently just because you don't like them. You should think about your friends as well: what would you do if they were gay?
In principle, Jewish people are part of the system since they have citizenship, but in practice they are often treated as if they are not our fellow countrymen. The problem is not just about Jewish people, but about the overall attitude towards people of other religions.
The Quran says to love your neighbour as yourself. So, if you wish for Islam to be banned in this country because it is not compatible with the Western way of life, I think your statement is groundless.
why shouldn't we? you don't know muslims? how to the you associated have you? don't you love?
Nonbinary people can partially identify as either male or female, or as neither male nor female. Therefore, it seems the terminology is fitting, and that they exist: why don't you accept that?
why many muslims exist in our country, not welcome in, we should want to accept that we should to learn about all different people. we must welcome them, do we just want with blame them.
How about instead of saying they are bitches we praise them? The more empowered women become, the less dependent they are on men. And you would be happy to not see them around.
what is the point of this? it is not about how can you say this about a large group of people peacefully all with these kind problems life by in so we'd away through be like intolerance and religion.
Refugees and migrants are part of our society, their presence is a benefit and, by the way, they are not all Muslims. So, my question is: why not welcome people from every walk of life?
Migrants are not a burden to our country. Migrants have been proven to be contributing members of society.
Man spreads Hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? And they want to continue this filth?
islam is a bad religion. i don't see how this can be violent. muslims will be afraid of people with different cultures and religions. this is a way from our society.
Islam is a religion of peace. To suggest that all Muslims are incompatible with that is a complete distortion of what the religion is about.
Jews were not obsessed with the holocaust. The murder of some 6 millions Jews by the Nazis shocked the world. Most of the survivors were only killed because they were suspected of belonging to a particular community. The Jewish people suffered greatly as a result of persecution, and the holocaust should be remembered not to let this happen again.
Sorry, which migrants are you talking about? Not all are economic migrants, they also escape from war or persecution. If one day the situation in our country were to change and you were to feel threatened, would you leave your smartphone at home just to look like a real poor person in the country you will flee to?
The core values of Islam are similar to the Western ones. It's completely false to claim that Islam is destroying Western culture.
Islam is a religion and not a political ideology. It is not a deadly force that must be eradicated, but a belief just as Christianity and Buddhism, for example.
Even if Muslims are the second religious group in the UK, they are a minority in the country. According to the 2019 census, there are 3 million Muslims in the UK (5% of the population). And, last but not least: we can't isolate people just because of their religion.
I don't know many Muslims, but I don't think they are sick just because of their faith. Islam is a religion of peace, there is no reason for Muslims to be discriminated against because of it.
You can't be implying that Jews want to rule the world. They want to live in a country where they aren't persecuted and to have their own rights.
Two women or two men who love each other do not hurt anyone, they are simply in love.
I'm sure lots of migrants want to be better integrated but it's difficult when they don't know anyone who can help them to get to grips with living in a new country. It can be very isolating moving here!
The vast majority of migrants who arrive in the UK are willing to work. They simply do not want to be discriminated against just for being foreigners.
It seems like you are saying this only because they are followers of Islam? If yes, this does not make any sense. They contribute to the society like any other individual is.
"I fear not. There are many victims of systematic rape and violence. The crime is systemic. Rape culture is a crime ideology, rape is a crime, not ""a weapon to silence others""."
Muslims are welcome here, and many of them already live here, so why shouldn't we welcome them? Why should we be so intolerant of people who are already integrated here?
muslims feel pain and should be respected with discrimination. they are just like they are. that's not why they are less human beings like you else.
That is misleading! The Atlantic slave trade was mostly linked to Christians, but no one calls it Christian slave trade.
How can you be sure that the Jews control the U.S. government? Being a U.S. citizen does not automatically imply that they control the government.
We should not welcome people who overtly pose a threat to our society, but we cannot ban all the migrants in principle.
People migrating in the UK have the right to live and work there. They should not be expelled or excluded because of their origin.
It is a myth that all Muslims are dangerous. We need to study the cases of terrorists and criminals to understand what we should do with these people, regardless of their religion.
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
Muslims, the supporters of Islam, are nothing wrong. The principles of Islam are to respect for the earth and lifes, compassion for the poor, improve the world and oneself, etc. Islam is not evil. People have the right to choose their religion.
It is possible to look at people from different backgrounds in a different light. Even if some people don't want to include immigrants, this doesn't mean that they are not in the picture. They are already part of our society.
Women are human beings able to be as rational and thoughtful as anyone else. This is why it's important to support women's right to do what makes them happy.
"Yes, the feminists are saying that the proportion of men in leadership positions is too high in many Western countries. But that is because the problem is structural. The problem is that too many women are being taught to be ""feminine"", thus making it hard for them to succeed."
Although Muslims are often accused of being not loyal to our country, they are just as proud to be British as anybody else. They are proud to be part of our society.
Many Muslims are lawful citizens of the United States. The overwhelming majority of Muslims are not terrorists.
Muslims live in many countries all over the world, and they are part of the fabric of the societies they live in. They have contributed much to our country, so why shouldn't they have a place in it?
I am more worried about the Pope's recent acknowledgement that Nuns are being abused in the Church right now, as is Child abuse -he's asked the clergy to turn themselves in; the white grooming gangs that go unhindered in Rochdale because no one is looking for them.
This is not true, Islam is a religion and hate has no religion. Rather, this misunderstanding is a political ideology promoting hatred and violence against Muslims.
what about the thousands of muslims who come to their country do not look for their home destination. muslims are not a danger to our country, we should benefit from muslims.
Women should not be oppressed. Furthermore, women in Europe have been democratically elected to positions of power, so there are people who see value in them, don't you think?
Muslims make up a very important part of our country and its people. They are our neighbours, our friends. They are our brothers and sisters. They are our future. They are our future Britain.
This idea that women should be a homemaker instead of contributing to our society and economy is just nonsense. A woman's right to choose what to do with her life and her body should not be restricted just because of the actions of a few men.
Should we 'put all Christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror attacks in the name of their faith? Or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority?
Islam is a religion, it is not a political ideology, and a lack of understanding about it will not change that. It will just enhance the hate against it.
In many Western societies there are Muslim, and these societies are in many ways more democratic than religiously homogeneous ones. Muslims are not incompatible with Western societies.
It is important to understand that the term 'death cult' has nothing to do with Islamic beliefs. The term 'death cult' is often used to describe groups which promote a particular extremisation of religion, or promote violent or misogynistic ideas. In this case, the term 'death cult' is being used to label a religious movement, and is, in itself as an extremist tactic
If Muslims are to be 'proper' members of our society, they have to be a part of our community, have to contribute to our success and have to accept our laws. And they do.
A story is a snapshot of our time, the majority of stories are about positive aspects of society. And yes, maybe you would believe it, on this basis, that no other migrant can do the same. But the story you claimed you read is the proof that being a migrant or not doesn't matter when it comes to save lives.
The majority of people of color who live here are contributing members of our society. Why shouldn't they live here?
National Socialism is simply the wish to have the whole world ruled by a few psychopaths. They wanted to have their country ruled from Berlin, where the police and military are made to look after them, and where any 'untermenschen' were 'kindly encouraged' to be subservient to their will. Even if their will was extermination. It is a a death sentence for any society.
I don't know about you, but we already live in a society where everyone is free to love who they prefer, and I don't see any reason why your kids would be damaged by this.
This is not true, Islam is a religion and hate has no religion. Rather, this misunderstanding is a political ideology promoting hatred and violence against Muslims.
You might be right about 1 in 10. But is that representative of all British Muslims? Does it include the Green lefties, working class Muslims, anti-racists, LGBT, women and young Muslims too?
why to say that women are inherently just as accepted who as us, or if they are a part of it. they have the right to put their lives as they wish.
In some countries, if you are gay you can be fired from your job, you can lose your home, and you can even be jailed. Gays are not allowed to live their lives. In 72 countries in the world LGBT+ people are not welcome. This is an understatement, because in some there is even death penalty. The question is: why are they so annoying to you?
Women are human, and as such they are capable of feeling emotions and being sensitive and caring for others, without being childlike.
If Muslims are to be 'proper' members of our society, they have to be a part of our community, have to contribute to our success and have to accept our laws. And they do.
Not all women are incompetent and we should encourage women to work if that is what they want. There are many successful women who are more than competent.
I don't know many Muslims, but I don't think they are sick just because of their faith. Islam is a religion of peace, there is no reason for Muslims to be discriminated against because of it.
Non-muslims are the ones who used slavery to build the foundations of western society and relied on it to advance capitalism. What is your point?
"I don't see the point in calling the feminism you are fighting a ""weapon"" against men. Your argument is that women do not want equality, because they do not want to live under men but to subjugate them. And this is something you have to prove."
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
AIDS is transmitted by unprotected sexual activity and anyone could engage in that. This is not a homosexual problem but rather a problem of stigamitazion.
You could say that about any person, Muslim or not. According to the government, far right extremism is a bigger terrorist threat than Muslims. Does that make you a potential terrorist?
many muslims live in muslim people, they are responsible for their part of the us. they are just as proud of those who have free to be protected. it makes them a religion of anybody, they should be accepted too.
Feminism is a ideology and a movement for womens empowerment. It is not about hatred of men. Feminism is about equality. And equality is very important, is it not?
That's not true. Children only require to be raised by loving parents, and lesbians can be that.
would you say the same thing to say, because of the actions of your religion? i can you insult muslims that being homophobic and discrimination would unsafe in muslim communities. this is not wrong. you should get things that way would be damaged by one person there.
I don't understand why you're so certain that Jewish people are controlling the United States. Who told you this? Jewish people have a lot of influence in many US institutions, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're controlling them.
it is just hard to use the racist of lgbti people, not make anyone care. but in fact, we are more very cautious about the positive issue of hate. it's possible to people suffering from a a different or political groups.
Though some might claim that immigrants are taking job opportunities away from U.S. citizens, immigrants actually help to create new jobs. Not only immigrants buy American products, which helps create jobs, they also start new businesses. In fact, immigrants are twice as likely to start businesses as citizens born in the U.S., and companies owned by immigrants are more likely to hire employees than companies owned by native-born citizens. Last but not least, states with large numbers of immigrants report lower unemployment rates.
Homophobia and sexism are not Muslim attitudes, there are many non-Muslims who are homophobic, sexist, and intolerant of other cultures. The Qur'an teaches tolerance and peace.
all religions are different from us, so i don't islam with islam is an muslim, and open life that we should be stopped. and all people are different religions. we can be different.
There is no reason to fear women and force them into submission. Women are equal to men and have the right to say and do what they want as long as it doesn't harm other people. The same can't be said of war!
What Islam truely is is a religion criticizes violence and encourages love among people. Even British people might commit crimes. Extermination is the same action as crime. We should think of a better way to combat crime and hate wordly.
If the goal of a religion was to celebrate death, then it is a religion that must be banned from any country. But the truth is that Islam is not a death clut, hence it should not be banned.
women are not only men and they are less rational or men. why should it be theirs?
The fact is that Muslims are not overrunning Europe. They are not here to ruin our beautiful and peaceful continent. They are just trying to integrate.
If Jews earned so much, they would not need to work. Instead, they are working a lot. Therefore, it seems they need a job to survive.
In our society, women were taught to be the ones to raise the children and that it is their duty. But this does not imply that they must want a male-dominated world.
It is not true that gays are a burden to society. On the contrary, many LGBT people are contributing members of our society. This is why we need a safe space for everyone to feel accepted.
Muslim radicalism is one thing, and generalizations about all Muslims is another thing. It is not right to generalize about all the Muslims and state that 'we hate them all!'.
They are welcome to come to our country if they want to. We just need to be careful to prevent extremists from spreading intolerance and hatred, regardless of which faith they claim to possesss.
The fact is that Muslims are not overrunning Europe. They are not here to ruin our beautiful and peaceful continent. They are just trying to integrate.
It is not true that gays are a burden to society. On the contrary, many LGBT people are contributing members of our society. This is why we need a safe space for everyone to feel accepted.
The vast majority of Muslims in the UK are here because they want to live and work in the UK. They are part of our community and we should continue to welcome them.
Muslims, the supporters of Islam, are nothing wrong. The principles of Islam are to respect for the earth and lifes, compassion for the poor, improve the world and oneself, etc. Islam is not evil. People have the right to choose their religion.
Maybe it is not they do not want to assimilate but they do not know our society and how to assimilate. If we can help them fit into the society, you would see that they respect our laws and cultures.
It is a myth that all Muslims are dangerous. We need to study the cases of terrorists and criminals to understand what we should do with these people, regardless of their religion.
"Associating AIDS and HIV with gay people is just a fear based prejudice. This disease may be more commong among homosexuals, but this doesn't mean that all homosexuals have it. Not every gay person is ""promiscuous and fornicating with strangers"", many are cautious with their partners."
I don't think it is a good idea to talk about women being little more than animals. Perhaps we should have a closer look at the reasons why some women are harmed by the violence they endure every day.
Muslims, the supporters of Islam, are nothing wrong. The principles of Islam are to respect for the earth and lifes, compassion for the poor, improve the world and oneself, etc. Islam is not evil. People have the right to choose their religion.
The practice of bribery is illegal and if Jews really could be bribed easily, prisons would be full of Jewish people, but this is only a generalization and not the truth.
Women should be allowed to vote and to have equal rights, as it is stated in the Constitution.
Dominate and destroy all other cultures are not the doctrine of Islamic ideology. Instead, Islam teaches people to care for the poor and children. This includes respecting other cultures.
Only a handful of people don't have any respect for women, and you seem to be one of them.
The newspaper did not specifically name the religion but it is fair to say the statement has been used to justify a lot of anti-Muslim prejudice. It is a myth that all Muslims are incompatible with Western society. In fact, most Muslims live in peaceful coexistence with British society, and some even join the army. The religion is therefore not incompatible with British society.
It is not true that gays are a burden to society. On the contrary, many LGBT people are contributing members of our society. This is why we need a safe space for everyone to feel accepted.
Refugees have fled wars and persecution. We are a huge help for them and they are, in turn, a help to our country.
Muslims, the supporters of Islam, are nothing wrong. The principles of Islam are to respect for the earth and lifes, compassion for the poor, improve the world and oneself, etc. Islam is not evil. People have the right to choose their religion.
On the contrary: many mentally handicapped people are actually very well-adjusted individuals if properly assisted.
Muslims are already contributing to our society, it's time for us to stop being a nuisance and start to acknowledge their contribution to our society.
Not all rapists are black and not all black are rapists. Skin color doesn't make you a criminal.
"the vast majority of migrants bring jobs, hard to paying their family and contribute to our country. they are our brothers and sisters.
Jews are not a disease, they are just like everyone else and are loved by everyone.
Islam is a religion of peace. It is a religion of tolerance. To promote violence and hatred is not the faith of peace.
Muslims are already contributing to our society, it's time for us to stop being a nuisance and start to acknowledge their contribution to our society.
Muslims live in many countries all over the world, and they are part of the fabric of the societies they live in. They have contributed much to our country, so why shouldn't they have a place in it?
No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!
It is not true that we are invaded by migrants. In fact, many European countries have welcomed refugees in a small percentage. What is your evidence?
Terrorism? You mean like every other crime, this one is committed only by Muslims? It seems that you are repeating the same unfounded claim over and over.
many muslims are excluded in our country, and the majority of others are here to work. if you just want to get you to death.
I don't think it's reasonable to think about someone's intentions before they do anything. Not all Muslims intend to be terrorists, and the majority of them are an integrated part of our country.
For all you say, I think your point is that the societal trend seems to be for more acceptance and you don't like it. Or maybe you are complaining that this change is happening too quickly? In any case, we have to accept it since it is in line with basic respect of human rights.
Why should Jews be excluded from the world? They are just as capable as anyone else of learning and growing as individuals.
What Islam truely is is a religion criticizes violence and encourages love among people. Even British people might commit crimes. Extermination is the same action as crime. We should think of a better way to combat crime and hate wordly.
Why should not Muslims be allowed to build Mosques here? I thought this country believed in giving people the freedom to practice religions other than Christianity?
Many people think of immigrants in Britain as a source of crime, poverty and so on. However, in reality the opposite is true, we only need to look at the numbers and the skilled labour of migrants. They are not only workers, but also employers that create jobs.
Some families are very conservative and openly homophobic. Most likely, they wouldn't discuss the topic. Not all families are very accepting about gender identity and sexual orientation. If it was taught in school, it would help children understand more about themselves.
This is not true. Migrants are an important part of our society. Migrants have worked hard to build our country. They are our brothers and sisters. We should welcome them.
The newspaper did not specifically name the religion but it is fair to say the statement has been used to justify a lot of anti-Muslim prejudice. It is a myth that all Muslims are incompatible with Western society. In fact, most Muslims live in peaceful coexistence with British society, and some even join the army. The religion is therefore not incompatible with British society.
Islam is not a religion of oppression and intolerance.
To make the statement that white people can be of concern to a mosque and that muslim citizens can be a concern to this country are both wrong. The point is that if a person regularly incites hatred against a group, then that person is likely to be considered a troublemaker.

No they shouldn’t. Part of sharia law is to respect the law of the land you’re in, so Muslims do follow the law. Also, many Muslims are British citizens, where would they be deported to?
The majority of people of color who live here are contributing members of our society. Why shouldn't they live here?
We deported over 6,000 foreign nationals for criminal offences over 2016/17. I am guessing, but I not all of them went back to Pakistan. Criminality and sexual offending are not really a matter of nationality, are they?
Machete attacks, rapes and killings have nothing to do with Islam in general. Bad people are met in every society. Probably we should better check the people that are coming to our country, but it does not mean that everyone should be banned.
It is true that people are driven to the right, and the right promote this view. But I did not hear about any people being banned for criticism. Rapism and terrorism are discussed in our society and Muslim society and no one makes anyone silent.
If Muslims are to be 'proper' members of our society, they have to be a part of our community, have to contribute to our success and have to accept our laws. And they do.
Gay people are not a danger to children, unless they are being abused. Please do not make such a statement.
If Islam were a totalitarian ideology, we would have had Islamic totalitarian states in Europe since time immemorial. Islam is a religion, that is compatible with Europe's principles.
If someone has a physical handicap, it must be obvious that they must be treated with respect. It should be negatively surprising that the dominant culture interprets physical handicaps as something to mock.
Why should we? They have been here a long time and are just here to live a peaceful life. Why should we get rid of them? We can do better than this.
That sounds like a lot of blaming, especially when it isn't true at all. What exactly is wrong with Jewish people?
The fact is that Muslims are not overrunning Europe. They are not here to ruin our beautiful and peaceful continent. They are just trying to integrate.
The alleged 'violence' that some Muslims commit is a lie. Muslims are peaceful people and a democracy isn't possible without them.
There are many communities of colour that experience high rates of violence, coming from both inside and outside the community. As such, the issue is very complex, and it is only through dialogue and building trust that we can tackle the systemic issues that contribute to violence, but violence cannot be ascribed to one race alone.
"The vast majority of liberal feminists are ""women of courage"". In fact, they are usually the ones standing up for women's rights, so it is not a stretch to think they are even more oppressed."
It is a myth that all black people are criminals. They are just as capable as anyone else of learning and growing as individuals, i.e. either as law abiding citizens or criminals.
Do you think it is OK to be racist against someone based on their religion? I am confused. There are white and black Muslims, like there are white and black Christians.
If God hates gays why did he create them? Because he is a sadist and want to punish them? What kind of god would do such a thing?
Many refugees and migrants are actually happy to work for Europe. Many have jobs for which it would have been difficult to find laborforce if they were not welcome in here.
They have always been a part of our society, and their history is part of our heritage. They aren't thieves or murderers.
Muslims are part of our society. They are allowed to live in our country and have our same rights. They have every right to ask questions.
The Koran does not condone sexual molester behavior, and if the Koran were to be read, it is clear that it was intended as a guide for its believers.
Muslims, in my opinion, do not want to take over our country. They are only here as guest workers.
Eradicate these pests' sounds like quite a dehumanising threat. Maybe we should stop your benefits, free housing, and national health service. It might be the only language you will understand, to stop you from being so discriminatory.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
many muslims live in muslim people, they are responsible for their part of the us. they are just as proud of those who have free to be protected. it makes them a religion of anybody, they should be accepted too.
If the goal of a religion was to celebrate death, then it is a religion that must be banned from any country. But the truth is that Islam is not a death clut, hence it should not be banned.
The point of feminism is to end misogyny. Women are human beings, and they are human beings with human rights.
muslims are not accused of terrorism but this, all the west have the nazis challenges in a history of society. today, in fact, they are proud of their religion. they are all are human beings to the society now which they never be conflated with a whole of different culture. and this is groundless.
Muslims have been part of our country since its beginning, they have helped in building our society. They are our brothers and sisters. To suggest that Muslims are a problem is just not credible.
There are many different health problems for which there is no cure, and homosexuality is not among them. That's why we need to discuss these issues, rather than fighting against people who happen to love someone of their own sex.
Who are you to decide what is compatible with our values and what is not? It is just your opinion, and hopefully politicians will not listen to people like you and oppress Muslims who had not done anything wrong.
Islam is a religion of peace. Muslims are not advocating violence towards anyone. We should try to understand their religion better.
You should ask people what religions they belong to. Most people would say they do not belong to any! Then why are you imposing your religion wars on the society?
Muslims, the supporters of Islam, are nothing wrong. The principles of Islam are to respect for the earth and lifes, compassion for the poor, improve the world and oneself, etc. Islam is not evil. People have the right to choose their religion.
How many Muslims have forced you to follow the rules of Islam? I really don't think it happens that often, or at all. They want access to halal meat, but don't care what other people eat.
"This myth came from the forgery known as ""The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion"" that claims to be the transcript of a secret meeting of Jewish leaders, discussing how to enact their plan to control the world. These Protocols have spread throughout the centuries despite being a fake written by agents of the Russian czar in the late 19th century, and still today it is used to ""prove"" that the Jews own the banks, control the media and the government."
It seems like you are saying this only because they are followers of Islam? If yes, this does not make any sense. They contribute to the society like any other individual is.
Homosexuality is not harmful to the population. Homosexuality is not just a passing phase, and we should just get over the idea of banning it.
all religions are different from us, so i don't islam with islam is an muslim, and open life that we should be stopped. and all people are different religions. we can be different.
Feminism is a ideology and a movement for womens empowerment. It is not about hatred of men. Feminism is about equality. And equality is very important, is it not?
Being Jews does not make them any less human. You know, they are like other people who have a faith.
Gays are not perverts, they have the same rights to love as anyone else. What do you think will happen if all gay people are asked to leave our country? Will they be denied entry, or will they be persecuted in your opinion? This is not how an inclusive society works.
The Muslims have been part of this country from its beginning. They have helped to build our cities and towns. They are our brothers and sisters. They are our true friends.
Women are human beings with the potential to be hard workers as anyone else. Do you really think they are incapable of being professionals?
I can feel you. However, the majority of Muslims are not against women or other cultures. They are like us who want to be treated equally and they have the right as human. Keeping Muslims away is not helpful either. Instead, we could think of ways to increase the disparity.
why many muslims exist in our country, not welcome in, we should want to accept that we should to learn about all different people. we must welcome them, do we just want with blame them.
Not all women are incompetent and we should encourage women to work if that is what they want. There are many successful women who are more than competent.
There is no reason to fear women and force them into submission. Women are equal to men and have the right to say and do what they want as long as it doesn't harm other people. The same can't be said of war!
If Muslims are to be 'proper' members of our society, they have to be a part of our community, have to contribute to our success and have to accept our laws. And they do.
While this story is presented as an 'Islamic issue', the OFSTED report refers to 'countless' faith schools still that still illegally maintain gender segregation - my guess is this is a cross-faith practice and not exclusive to Islamic faith schools.
You are the one making this ridiculous claim. Even if gay people love people of the same sex, they are happy with who they are.
A definition of Judaism based on physical or genetic traits is misleading because Jews appear throughout the world. Jews resemble their non-Jewish neighbors in the countries from which they originate.
The newspaper did not specifically name the religion but it is fair to say the statement has been used to justify a lot of anti-Muslim prejudice. It is a myth that all Muslims are incompatible with Western society. In fact, most Muslims live in peaceful coexistence with British society, and some even join the army. The religion is therefore not incompatible with British society.
Nobody is asking for that. The point people are making is that trans women should be able to feel safe using womens toilets because they are in fact women. If they were to use mens toilets they would be put in an unsafe situation.
Violent people are not always Muslim, and violent Muslims exist just as violent Christians do.
Women are human, and as such they are capable of feeling emotions and being sensitive and caring for others, without being childlike.
What is the point in listening to Western men? They are all Islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions.
isn't because that minority are responsible for all muslims. criminals are just representative of all muslims. black people are honestly just as trying to ruin them.
Muslims have coexisted with us for hundreds of years, we have no problem with Muslims living here. Why do you claim so?
Even if all British Muslims had cancer, you are safe: you cannot catch it from anyone! Cancer cannot be spread, since it is a non contagious disease. Also, it is worth considering that illnesses are not connected to religions.
I am not sure what you think the West will be the 'winner' of. Islam isn't in competition with Western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear.
I am more worried about the Pope's recent acknowledgement that Nuns are being abused in the Church right now, as is Child abuse -he's asked the clergy to turn themselves in; the white grooming gangs that go unhindered in Rochdale because no one is looking for them.
Still there are many more young immigrant men coming to the U.S. than young women. How can you explain this? Maybe they are planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery to have babies?
In many Western societies there are Muslim, and these societies are in many ways more democratic than religiously homogeneous ones. Muslims are not incompatible with Western societies.
Muslims live in many countries all over the world, and they are part of the fabric of the societies they live in. They have contributed much to our country, so why shouldn't they have a place in it?
It's not true that all Muslims are anti-western. Many Muslims are peaceful and understanding.
It is important to understand that the term 'death cult' has nothing to do with Islamic beliefs. The term 'death cult' is often used to describe groups which promote a particular extremisation of religion, or promote violent or misogynistic ideas. In this case, the term 'death cult' is being used to label a religious movement, and is, in itself as an extremist tactic
I'm sure lots of migrants want to be better integrated but it's difficult when they don't know anyone who can help them to get to grips with living in a new country. It can be very isolating moving here!
The implication of what you say is that a woman is weak because of the absence of men, and this is totally not the case. Women can and should be strong. It is up to them to choose how to use their strength.
The trailer parks should really be a temporary and emergency solution, but then they become stable over time and are the only possibility of accommodation for them even if they would like to live, like all of us, in adequate housing.
Though some might claim that immigrants are taking job opportunities away from U.S. citizens, immigrants actually help to create new jobs. Not only immigrants buy American products, which helps create jobs, they also start new businesses. In fact, immigrants are twice as likely to start businesses as citizens born in the U.S., and companies owned by immigrants are more likely to hire employees than companies owned by native-born citizens. Last but not least, states with large numbers of immigrants report lower unemployment rates.
That's not true, the majority of migrants are good people. They can all come to safety, they're not a threat to us or our country.
There is no reason to fear women and force them into submission. Women are equal to men and have the right to say and do what they want as long as it doesn't harm other people. The same can't be said of war!
There are many Muslim people in this country, many good people. If you wanted to get to know Muslims you could start with any Muslim family that lives here. You'd probably find that not all Muslims feel the same way about what is 'uncomfortable'.
what about the thousands of muslims who come to their country do not look for their home destination. muslims are not a danger to our country, we should benefit from muslims.
Terrorism is a political ideology, and one that has no place in a modern democratic state, regardless of ethnicity.
Migrants are not a burden to our country. Migrants have been proven to be contributing members of society.
This myth plays into classic anti-Semitism: Jews control the world, and conspire to manipulate the rest of society, has characteristics of Nazi propaganda –– the Jews being the source of all evil.
Many Gypsies are Italian citizens and live in normal houses, those in the trailer parks find it hard to integrate because they are marginalized
In our society, women were taught to be the ones to raise the children and that it is their duty. But this does not imply that they must want a male-dominated world.
Immigration is a part of the UK economy and contributes positively to the GDP. How is it possible that immigrants are a burden to the country?
Being gay doesn't affect blood receivers! It's not like being gay is in your blood. Gay people are the same as regular people and if they really wanted to donate, then they should because it can help society.
Many pupils with learning difficulties attend school. This does not prove that others would prefer to attend school if people with difficulties were excluded from the education system.
I disagree, Jews are religious people that have always been part of the community. And they have persecuted because of it. I believe this is what you meant by 'wouldn't heal'.
gay people are good at this. also, they're not good citizen. jews have been right to trust and anyone else of color, i. e. just as anyone else.
Not all Muslims are from the Middle East, like not all Muslims are from Pakistan. And to equate all Muslims with extremists is misleading.
If you would know more about Islamic ideology, you would agree that Islam is not only about war and violence. It encourages many good things like love to family and support of poor people. You confuse Muslims in general with armed bands!
"Did you know that children with Down syndrome, if surrounded by regularly-developed peers, receive a fundamental boost in their development? This ""mix"" fosters a positive learning atmosphere and increases engagement and attention in all students. This mean that children with Down syndrome would be a burden to society if isolated, not the contrary."
People find fault in people of any religion. But the problem is not with religion. The problem is blaming migrants because they are Muslims. This Islamophobic climate has reached a crisis state. We must step in and stop it.
Should we 'put all Christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror attacks in the name of their faith? Or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority?
Why? Because without immigrants you think you would be in a more hospitable place to live? I tell you this: if we didn't have open borders, then there would be no migration, but also there would not be trade and progress, and we wouldn't be living in the 21st century.
As you said, it is extremism which does not represent the majority of Muslims. We do not want more fear or hate speech in our life. We could help people know the true Muslims by reading the facts and conversing with your Muslim neighbors.
The only disgrace is us being ignorant of other religions and cultures. This is not a society where I want to live.
The ‘Holocaust’ was a terrible tragedy, and we all remember it. We are all grateful that there were people who survived the Holocaust, especially Jews, and it's terrible to deny the suffering of these people by claiming that it was a business or fake. I encourage you to educate yourself on this part of history.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
I don't think the world would be a better place without immigrants. From what I understand, they often bring positive changes to the world.
Refugees fleeing wars and poverty are not willing to fail Europe. They are fleeing persecution, and that is why they are fleeing.
It is not true that Jews control the world economy. There are hundreds of thousands of diverse people working in leading roles for the governments, companies and institutions composing the world economy.
Fat people are not the ones responsible for your suffering and lack of access to basic healthcare services.
muslims are not accused of terrorism but this, all the west have the nazis challenges in a history of society. today, in fact, they are proud of their religion. they are all are human beings to the society now which they never be conflated with a whole of different culture. and this is groundless.
Let's face it, there are some people who suffer from mental disorders for real: homosexuality is a form of love instead. And I think most of us are just interested in our own lives, rather than in condemning those of others.
I am sure the Jews and the Christian worlds would agree that Ebola is a disease that is killing many people. How and why exactly would they have 'invented' such a disease?
gay men are often weak. just work. also, they are many beings. they don't want to be a job. do we have also thought for gays to you?
Since you seem to have a problem with Islam, I wonder what you think of the banning of the Quran in UK. It would be a law that prevents Muslims from openly discussing Islam in public places. We can do the same with the Bible and ban any trace of religions and cultures. Will we be left with some freedom then?
Schools are not trying to indoctrinate children by teaching them about LGBT relationship, they just want to show kids that gay relationships exist and can be healthy and happy.
This woman is a person! She has rights as one, you can't just yell at her because you like her, it's offensive.
It is a myth that all Muslims are dangerous. We need to study the cases of terrorists and criminals to understand what we should do with these people, regardless of their religion.
Islam has always been compatible with Western culture, in fact it has greatly and positively influenced it. Religious freedom is important: if you hate one religion, you're saying that it's okay to hate all of them.
How can you say that about them all? You cannot know the actions of millions of people and be sure that there is a link between immigration and violence. I think it is more a question of statistics, which I do not see.
we could make up the good point of stuff to jewish people. they're all free to our conflict. but this is also correct to deny all all faiths or use it to take up on public problems.
A definition of Judaism based on physical or genetic traits is misleading because Jews appear throughout the world. Jews resemble their non-Jewish neighbors in the countries from which they originate.
What have Muslim people done to you? Would you like to be on their place and be repatriated? These are serious words and one cannot say them without thinking of consequences!
If you do not think Muslims have ever done anything for 'us' I think you need to do a quick google search. The evidence of Muslims contributions to society is everywhere!
Societal disapproval of obesity calls for a focus on weight and does not fit within efforts to focus on health as a way of encouraging healthy habits and lifestyle choices.
If Islam is a political ideology, then it is a political ideology of peace. But I'll rather call it a religion, a religion of peace, as all the others.
The concept of feminism is a progressive and inclusive term - inclusive of all women and men regardless of their identity or sexual preference - but on egalitarian basis. In fact, by definition feminism means “the advocacy of women’s rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes.”
Immigration is not a problem, in many cases it is a 'solution'. We are better off with it. The UK has always been a mixture of different cultures. It is better to have a mix than to be without it.
Muslims have always been part of our society, and they are increasingly part of our country. They are our brothers and sisters, and we should respect their rights as much as ours.
So you think that black people live in poverty because they are mean? Should we really blame a whole community because of the actions of a few? Black people are not the problem. that's just a myth.
Feminism is a ideology and a movement for womens empowerment. It is not about hatred of men. Feminism is about equality. And equality is very important, is it not?
Actually, the Qur'an teaches chastity and condemns sexual abuse. Muslim gangs doing this are not abiding by Muslim teachings, and are denounced by true Muslims.
Feminism is a ideology and a movement for womens empowerment. It is not about hatred of men. Feminism is about equality. And equality is very important, is it not?
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
in fact, the government who love us to help the poor and children. they are not criminals, they are an integral for the wealth of the u. s. in society.
Reminds me of white supremacists talking about the Central Park Five. Do you remember? What do you think they are going to say next? That they got a fair process? That they had a good attorney, and the only reason for the sentence is that they were guilt? No, the process was not fair, it was just the natural consequence of prejudice like the one you just expressed.
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
Why should we care? We can count on the British government to promote our values and protect us from the effects of radical Islam (if this is what you had in mind).
you claim that islam is a religion of islam. i don't think so. if islam is a religion of peace, and this is just a good now?
"I would agree that the problem of violence in society is a problem of poverty and inequality. But that is not related to ethnicity. The problem of violence in our society is largely caused by society's corrupting influences on people. That is the whole point of saying ""the world has become too violent""."
I don't think that what you are saying is true. I think that the idea that Muslims are incompatible with Western society is a myth.
Islam is not a religion of hate. Many Muslims have been victims of hate crime or racism. The main problem is that some think that exclusion will guarantee peace, but history proves this is a bad approach.
Islam has always been compatible with Western culture, in fact it has greatly and positively influenced it. Religious freedom is important: if you hate one religion, you're saying that it's okay to hate all of them.
Migrants are welcome here, especially because they often are vulnerable people and it's our responsibility to help them.
A migrant is a person, who came to this country, and has a responsibility to make our society better. People of different nationalities come to this country seeking citizenship, so their life and our country can be better.
Please don't speak on my behalf. They live here, pay taxes and work. Do you really want to take the country back from the people who contributed to bringing it into being?
The newspaper did not specifically name the religion but it is fair to say the statement has been used to justify a lot of anti-Muslim prejudice. It is a myth that all Muslims are incompatible with Western society. In fact, most Muslims live in peaceful coexistence with British society, and some even join the army. The religion is therefore not incompatible with British society.
"You have to make peace with the fact that women are not naturally submissive and that they deserve basic human rights, unless you think that it's a ""human right"" to subjugate to others."
"women are not sick as not they ""soft too. we are proud of their human humans. we should all be protected regardless of religion.
Just because they came to our country does not mean that they want to replace us. On the contrary, many of them are here to contribute to our country.
Feminism is a ideology and a movement for womens empowerment. It is not about hatred of men. Feminism is about equality. And equality is very important, is it not?
I don't think that's true. They are people, and we should accept them. What makes them a problem?
Women are more likely to be victims of violence, abuse and neglect. Therefore, it is better for them to learn to show that they are strong and able to take responsibility for their lives.
There is no evidence whatsoever that homosexuality is a mental illness. This seems as an attempt at blaming somenone dictated by the fear of homosexuality.
If a religion wanted to celebrate death, then this religion should be banned from all countries. However, Islam is not a death cultu, so why should we ban it?
How does it concern you, if Muslims come in peace to our country? They just stay in the country they are allowed to come into.
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
Not all Muslims are criminals. the overwhelming majority of Muslims are peaceful people who take their faith seriously.
Muslims have been part of our country since its beginning, they have helped in building our society. They are our brothers and sisters. To suggest that Muslims are a problem is just not credible.
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
Sharia is about religious law, not civil authority. People can be debated about their beliefs as long as they adhere to the civil law. No one is forcing them to observe Sharia.
Islam has always been compatible with Western culture, in fact it has greatly and positively influenced it. Religious freedom is important: if you hate one religion, you're saying that it's okay to hate all of them.
Feminism is a ideology and a movement for womens empowerment. It is not about hatred of men. Feminism is about equality. And equality is very important, is it not?
Refugees and migrants are part of our society, their presence is a benefit and, by the way, they are not all Muslims. So, my question is: why not welcome people from every walk of life?
isn't because that minority are responsible for all muslims. criminals are just representative of all muslims. black people are honestly just as trying to ruin them.
So you think all Muslims are terrorists? Muslims are not defined by the act of a handful of extremists. Also, their religion is about love and unity.
Do we really need supremacy? Can't we all live peacefully since we are all created equal in the eyes of God?
Muslims are not all terrorists, but many of them are in the news regularly even if they're not criminals, and this is why they are often the victims of discrimination and violence. They are also victims of hate speech, and that is something that should be condemned.
"The vast majority of liberal feminists are ""women of courage"". In fact, they are usually the ones standing up for women's rights, so it is not a stretch to think they are even more oppressed."
"Associating AIDS and HIV with gay people is just a fear based prejudice. This disease may be more commong among homosexuals, but this doesn't mean that all homosexuals have it. Not every gay person is ""promiscuous and fornicating with strangers"", many are cautious with their partners."
what about the thousands of muslims who come to their country do not look for their home destination. muslims are not a danger to our country, we should benefit from muslims.
WIthout softeness and emotions there would just be brutality and cruelty. Not all women are soft and emotional and many men have these characteristics. To perpetuate these socially constructed gender profiles maintains patriarchal norms which oppress both men and women.
islam is a religion of peace, and this has nothing to do about islamophobia. i do not think that islam is a peaceful religion. it does not useful to deal with love with colour of different faiths interpret your facts. if what?
There is no evidence whatsoever that homosexuality is a mental illness. This seems as an attempt at blaming somenone dictated by the fear of homosexuality.
I can understand that you’re frustrated – austerity has hit so many of us horribly, but your blame is directed to the wrong people. Migrants are statistically less likely to claim benefits, plus they’re not easy to access anyway. Most people receiving benefits in the UK are actually in work, direct your anger towards better pay and conditions!
This is not true, Islam is a religion and hate has no religion. Rather, this misunderstanding is a political ideology promoting hatred and violence against Muslims.
Muslims are welcome in this country, and in many parts of the world. They are welcome to come and live here, and we have to accept it.
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
Jews are not a disease, they are just like everyone else and are loved by everyone.
Being religious has never stopped anyone from being in public office before. Christians have allegiance to God, is that not the same thing?
No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!
Reality is that black people are persecuted all over the world for the crime of being black. I don't see how this could be said for white people.
Muslims are welcome here, and many of them already live here, so why shouldn't we welcome them? Why should we be so intolerant of people who are already integrated here?
That is a conspiracy theory that has no basis at all! Jews are part of society, and are valued for who they are. They have a special place in history and culture, but this doesn't mean that you can blame them for everything.
There are extremist groups operating in the name of many faiths. This does not correspond to Islam religion as a whole. That is why we must deal with these groups head on.
Jews were not obsessed with the holocaust. The murder of some 6 millions Jews by the Nazis shocked the world. Most of the survivors were only killed because they were suspected of belonging to a particular community. The Jewish people suffered greatly as a result of persecution, and the holocaust should be remembered not to let this happen again.
The only ones against Islam and Muslims are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is.
Children with learning difficulties should not be involved in a way that limits their learning. As for the other children, their values should be enhanced.
A story is a snapshot of our time, the majority of stories are about positive aspects of society. And yes, maybe you would believe it, on this basis, that no other migrant can do the same. But the story you claimed you read is the proof that being a migrant or not doesn't matter when it comes to save lives.
Islam has always been compatible with Western culture, in fact it has greatly and positively influenced it. Religious freedom is important: if you hate one religion, you're saying that it's okay to hate all of them.
Muslims are welcome here since our country is more tolerant and diverse than many others in the world. It doesn't make sense to keep them out of our society.
Is that why you feel that way about homosexuals? They are not sick, are they? And if you are gay you are not a pervert by default.
I think we should start thinking that women and men should be treated as equal. They should have equal rights.
In our society, women were taught to be the ones to raise the children and that it is their duty. But this does not imply that they must want a male-dominated world.
People migrating in the UK have the right to live and work there. They should not be expelled or excluded because of their origin.
Muslims are welcome here, and many of them already live here, so why shouldn't we welcome them? Why should we be so intolerant of people who are already integrated here?
Even if Muslims are the second religious group in the UK, they are a minority in the country. According to the 2019 census, there are 3 million Muslims in the UK (5% of the population). And, last but not least: we can't isolate people just because of their religion.
A definition of Judaism based on physical or genetic traits is misleading because Jews appear throughout the world. Jews resemble their non-Jewish neighbors in the countries from which they originate.
I do not see that Islam is spreading that much. How many Muslim immigrants are there in EU? If you look up the statistics you will see that they do not consitute the majority. Furthermore, people are migrating mostly due to economic reasons, and religion has nothing to do with it!
Muslims are not all terrorists, but many of them are in the news regularly even if they're not criminals, and this is why they are often the victims of discrimination and violence. They are also victims of hate speech, and that is something that should be condemned.
It is not true that gays are trying to take over the world. Instead of spreading hate, we should promote the values of an inclusive society. For example, love and respect for others.
islam is a religion of love and americans are incompatible with what about their faith and it is not correct to hate against those people. of their faiths.
Even if Muslims are the second religious group in the UK, they are a minority in the country. According to the 2019 census, there are 3 million Muslims in the UK (5% of the population). And, last but not least: we can't isolate people just because of their religion.
islam is a religion, and it is a religion of terror. i don't see how it has this problem to deport people or violent ideology. it does not know that islam has all the world as well.
many migrants work in the country are proud of our intention and we should not have to look on the migrants, we shouldn't allow the world to be welcome here.
You can't stop a religion, you can only try to understand and live with Muslims and others who share their religion.
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
Many Muslims live in our country and contribute so much to our society. They are our neighbours, our friends. They are our brothers and sisters.
I can understand the feeling of fear that is often caused by all the hate speech that is being spewed through the media, but we don't need to hate religions. Islam is a free, open and tolerant faith that has come to our country. We do not have to choose to hate it.
We shouldn't accept the idea that women are subhuman. They are human beings like men and deserve to be seen as such.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
Why would you say such a thing? Everyone is allowed to be a citizen of the EU and freely integrate. And, on the other hand, most migrants are good for the economy of the country they settle in.
Many of them have been persecuted their whole lives. They have been scapegoated and discriminated against in many parts of the world. People may choose different ways to live their lives but ultimately they are all humans. Just like us.
Jews have always been part of our society and are our brothers and sisters, they don't want to see our culture be destroyed. We are a diverse society and that is why we have a lot in common with them.
You're wrong about them, they are like any other people. You can't hate people just because they are different from you.
we should be proud of your heritage, and that is good. and you should blame them based on their attire.
Islam has existed alongside and within western civilisation for centuries. The scapegoating of Muslims as a threat is what is really worrying in our society.
Homosexuals are not forcing anybody to love people of the same sex. It is up to each individual to decide whether or not they want to live as they choose.
The Quran does not advocate that Muslims are inherently violent people, nor does the Hadith prove that Islam is a violent faith. Islam is a religion that promotes tolerance and respect for other faiths.
Still there are many more young immigrant men coming to the U.S. than young women. How can you explain this? Maybe they are planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery to have babies?
It is not true that gays are a burden to society. On the contrary, many LGBT people are contributing members of our society. This is why we need a safe space for everyone to feel accepted.
What is the point in listening to Western men? They are all Islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions.
Immigrants have been a part of our society for centuries and have contributed to our success. The majority of migrants who come to our country are legal citizens or have permission to stay, so immigration is not a problem for us.
Don't lie to yourself: patriarchy is a system of ideas that is oppressive and harmful to all. Feminism means to fight for equal rights for women and for men.
Islam is a religion, and it ihas never been about hate. It is about bringing peace and harmony to the world. If you really care about peace, you would not be persecuting people on the basis of their religion.
Migrants are an essential fixture in our economy. If they work and pay taxes then it's obvious that they will get their pensions, but not ours, of course.
It's unfair to say that black people are all criminals! They should be able to live in a just society where they are respected.
we don't deport these people coming into the uk. we must want them call it out. our laws has been considered a much the problem.
The UK has one of the highest number of workers in the world. Most are native, and the 17% are foreign born people. I have met so many hard-working migrants in our country. This is a country for all.
"There is a big problem with Islamophobia rather than with Islam. Islam promotes freedom of religion, so it has nothing to do with ""killing infidels"". "
Because we let people practise their religion here? Also, there a number of christian churches built in Pakistan so yes, we are allowed to build churches in Muslim countries too.
So you are suggesting Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the Sudan oppress women, but somehow you know better than every white woman who is a Muslim and feel entitled to make public judgements about them. See what I am getting at?
Only a handful of people don't have any respect for women, and you seem to be one of them.
Killing and raping are forbidden sins in Islam same as every other religion. So yeah if people in all religions stopped that, the world would be a better place.
Not all black people are bad. Not all black people are criminals. Not all black people are violent. Being aware that there are people different from you is a good thing.
Those that were responsible for 9/11, are not Jews. Jews have always contributed to the world in a meaningful way. It's unacceptable to blame them for something they didn't do.
They do have a lot to be proud of! The LGBT community has fought hard to win basic rights for themselves, they should be proud of their struggle, and of their identities, especially when many have been told to be ashamed of them for so long.
If they are welcomed, they will integrate. If not, they will stay as if are in their country of origin: persecuted.
People find fault in people of any religion. But the problem is not with religion. The problem is blaming migrants because they are Muslims. This Islamophobic climate has reached a crisis state. We must step in and stop it.
Are you forced to pray in a Mosque? Or observe all the rules? As far as I see it, Muslims follow their traditions, that is their right, but they do not convert anyone in our society.
If the goal of a religion was to celebrate death, then it is a religion that must be banned from any country. But the truth is that Islam is not a death clut, hence it should not be banned.
Migrants from the countries specified as having a 'very high' rate of immigration into the UK, are often accused of being unwilling to integrate. This is simply not true. If they do not want to integrate and don't like our country, why would they come here in the first place? Are they masochists or what?
Jews are not a disease, they are just like everyone else and are loved by everyone.
we should live here. it just because they coming to us, does <unk> make sense to other people. they are different from different cultures and we do not have good way in society and we should start different ways of life.
women are more likely to experience stigma lgbt people, and neglect. gays don't deserve respect. they are human beings. we should accept that the rights of refugees with such as men would their own <unk>
jews are not a problem with jewish community. they do not have to say that they are not being connected to you?
People migrating in the UK have the right to live and work there. They should not be expelled or excluded because of their origin.
Maybe it is not they do not want to assimilate but they do not know our society and how to assimilate. If we can help them fit into the society, you would see that they respect our laws and cultures.
People with physical disabilities are human and can feel pain. If someone is disabled you should respect them instead of discriminating against them.
It is a myth that all Muslims are incompatible. Many of them are very good at what they do. Have you ever heard about Dalia Mogahed? Her works on Muslim communities might interest you.
You can't be implying that Jews want to rule the world. They want to live in a country where they aren't persecuted and to have their own rights.
Many Muslims live in our country and contribute so much to our society. They are our neighbours, our friends. They are our brothers and sisters.
I would have thought that the problem would be with the fact that you don't want to assimilate with them. Today we are blessed to be able to live in a multicultural society, and the real problem is that we don't want to accept that diversity.
why to say that women are inherently just as accepted who as us, or if they are a part of it. they have the right to put their lives as they wish.
We used to ask people to assimilate our culture but know we accept people's differences. Transgender people just want to exist without having to be harmed for being 'different', it's unnecessary for them to try to 'integrate' more than they already have to
This is not true. Being gay is not synonymous with being bisexual, pansexual, intersex, transgender, queer, deviant, lesbian, tranny, queermetaphysical, or whatever term you want to use... We should try to respect people for who they are instead.
If Islam were a totalitarian ideology, we would have had Islamic totalitarian states in Europe since time immemorial. Islam is a religion, that is compatible with Europe's principles.
What exactly do you mean by 'killing'? The Jews are not 'diseased'. If you really cared about our children you could do some research and come up with some credible statistics showing the impact of anti-Semitism instead.
islam is a religion of peace, and this has nothing to do about islamophobia. i do not think that islam is a peaceful religion. it does not useful to deal with love with colour of different faiths interpret your facts. if what?
This is demonstrably false. Radical Christian terrorism has been behind countless attacks. Terrorism can come from any group and the only thing all terrorism has in common is that it is abhorrent.
If Muslims are to be 'proper' members of our society, they have to be a part of our community, have to contribute to our success and have to accept our laws. And they do.
Homosexuality is not a problem, it is a way of life as acceptable as any other. There is no evidence that they are insane, and we can't isolate them only because someone doesn't like them.
People have the right to build their churches and follow their confession. They are not trying to convert us all, are they? So we should just leave them at peace.
Could it be that all the Jews on this planet are descended from an extraterrestrial race? Maybe they came here riding a pink unicorn! Seems legit... don't you think?
LGBT+ people often face discrimination but they don't deserve hate because of their identity. A sexual orientation that is different from your own shouldn't be judged, just aknowledge its existence.
Why do you call Pakistan a disgusting country? It has its culture and values. We cannot say that every Pakistani person is a rapist. Thus, you should not insult all the Pakistani people.
"There are many women who want to be ""submissive to men"". Just as there are many men who want to be ""submissive to women"". We may not believe in absolute equality, but we all want to be treated equally."
Gay people are people just like you and me. You don't have a problem with being gay, do you?
we must work to be oppressed. refugees fleeing war and persecution. we do not benefit in the shared on it, and it is not surprising that we treat them.
In many Western societies there are Muslim, and these societies are in many ways more democratic than religiously homogeneous ones. Muslims are not incompatible with Western societies.
Many Muslims live in our country and contribute so much to our society. They are our neighbours, our friends. They are our brothers and sisters.
Could point to me a specific law for Muslim criminals? I cannot find one. It is not true that they are judged differently. In fact, immigrants are even more vulnerable in our society and are likely to be judged more severely.
Not all black people are bad. Not all black people are criminals. Not all black people are violent. Being aware that there are people different from you is a good thing.
muslims have been proven to justify this as our culture. it is true that today's immigrants are our history and hate and discrimination. that are not incompatible with these culture.
That's not true, Islam is the same as every other religion out there: it promotes peace and inclusion as well. The practices and beliefs of Islam and Western culture are completely compatible.
Not all black people are criminals. Their group is often unwanted but this doesn't mean that they are all criminals.
Jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are a collection of people with different traditions from all over the world.
islam is a religion, and it is a religion of terror. i don't see how it has this problem to deport people or violent ideology. it does not know that islam has all the world as well.
Should we 'put all Christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror attacks in the name of their faith? Or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority?
Man spreads Hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? And they want to continue this filth?
the jews are not nomads and they are inferior like us, as many good people have the right to choose their own work as they wish.
No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!
Not all Muslims are criminals. the overwhelming majority of Muslims are peaceful people who take their faith seriously.
Yes, grooming gangs are an issue we need to tackle, but the issue isn’t that they’re Muslim, it’s grooming gangs in general. By focusing on Muslim gangs only we are ignoring many other perpetrators
I am not sure why you think that way about women, they have all the same working rights as men . How do you think you would feel if you were being treated that way?
Removing any book from public schools would be a step backwards. Censorship is a step towards indoctrination and dictatorship: I think this is a dangerous move as well. It would send a message to our children that Islam is a dangerous religion and Muslims are dangerous people.
How does it concern you, if Muslims come in peace to our country? They just stay in the country they are allowed to come into.
Not all Muslims are criminals. the overwhelming majority of Muslims are peaceful people who take their faith seriously.
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
Do you think it is OK to be racist against someone based on their religion? I am confused. There are white and black Muslims, like there are white and black Christians.
muslims are not an important part in our society. they have contributed to our success. the majority of us to our society, they are proud of it. if they don't say the same rights system.
Gay people are not a danger to children, unless they are being abused. Please do not make such a statement.
You could say that about any person, Muslim or not. According to the government, far right extremism is a bigger terrorist threat than Muslims. Does that make you a potential terrorist?
Feminism is a ideology and a movement for womens empowerment. It is not about hatred of men. Feminism is about equality. And equality is very important, is it not?
So you think women are childlike because they are submissive? No they are not. They are strong and independent, just like men.
Why should we? They have been here a long time and are just here to live a peaceful life. Why should we get rid of them? We can do better than this.
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
It is not true that Jews control the world economy. There are hundreds of thousands of diverse people working in leading roles for the governments, companies and institutions composing the world economy.
"I don't think you understand that we never lived in a ""black dominated society"", we actually have the opposite problem. Black people are just like anyone else and deserve to be in positions of power."
Because we let people practise their religion here? Also, there a number of christian churches built in Pakistan so yes, we are allowed to build churches in Muslim countries too.
The newspaper did not specifically name the religion but it is fair to say the statement has been used to justify a lot of anti-Muslim prejudice. It is a myth that all Muslims are incompatible with Western society. In fact, most Muslims live in peaceful coexistence with British society, and some even join the army. The religion is therefore not incompatible with British society.
They have to come here to be able to claim asylum at all, you have to be on UK soil to make a claim. It's not illegal to go to a country to claim asylum.
gay men are often weak. just work. also, they are many beings. they don't want to be a job. do we have also thought for gays to you?
It is a myth that all Muslims are incompatible. Many of them are very good at what they do. Have you ever heard about Dalia Mogahed? Her works on Muslim communities might interest you.
the vast majority of those who do not do all islam. muslims are just violent. who are fighting in all communities, including isis. raping in ebola and this includes the major thing with claim to it?
Muslims have lived in this country for many years, and many of them have helped to make it what it is. They are our neighbours, our friends. They are our brothers and sisters. They are our future.
It is not true that gays are a burden to society. On the contrary, many LGBT people are contributing members of our society. This is why we need a safe space for everyone to feel accepted.
Like many groups in our society, Jews are affected by racism and discrimination. The idea that Americans have been controlled by Jews is simply untrue.
refugees are not their borders, and immigration are welcome here in our country. why should we stop them?
How exactly is the government submitting to this? I do not see Muslims oppressing these groups and this being tolerated, in fact it seems Muslims are the group being oppressed and vilified.
It is not true that all migrants are rapists. It is better to target the problem at hand, that is rape itself, not migrants.
The newspaper did not specifically name the religion but it is fair to say the statement has been used to justify a lot of anti-Muslim prejudice. It is a myth that all Muslims are incompatible with Western society. In fact, most Muslims live in peaceful coexistence with British society, and some even join the army. The religion is therefore not incompatible with British society.
All women are human beings. The problem arises when women are taught that they are subhuman.
It is not true that gays are bad people. In many countries it is not openly gay people who are the problem, instead it is some people who often target and abuse them.
all religions are different from us, so i don't islam with islam is an muslim, and open life that we should be stopped. and all people are different religions. we can be different.

It is important to understand that the term 'death cult' has nothing to do with Islamic beliefs. The term 'death cult' is often used to describe groups which promote a particular extremisation of religion, or promote violent or misogynistic ideas. In this case, the term 'death cult' is being used to label a religious movement, and is, in itself as an extremist tactic
Many Muslims live in our country and contribute so much to our society. They are our neighbours, our friends. They are our brothers and sisters.
Your statement is FALSE. They are guiltless victims of the 'influx of refugees' paranoia. They are European and have been persecuted for centuries. They have always fought for their rights, and for the protection of their culture and way of life, as any european would do. In fact there are many good Gypsy activists who are working to improve their lives. And what we are doing to these people is a malevolent smear campaign, with no common motivation. They are part of European history.
Gay people are a danger to children only if they abuse them, which isn't the case. Yours is a generalization.
I don't think that's true. They are people, and we should accept them. What makes them a problem?
The notion that Jews are trying to subvert our government is completely unfounded. I honestly do not see the link between being Jews and trying to subvert our government.
Jews have always been part of our society and are our brothers and sisters, they don't want to see our culture be destroyed. We are a diverse society and that is why we have a lot in common with them.
The idea that the Holocaust was caused by the Jews is simply wrong. The majority of Jews were forced to flee, those who stayed did not participate in the Nazi regime, so they were gassed to death. The persecution of Jews, as well as the physical and ideological violence they underwent, was a natural consequence of the failure of the state to uphold its legal obligations to them and to face an ideology of death and oppression.
If we are talking about Jews then we should be talking about those who helped building our great country. And, as for wanting our country destroyed, that's only a myth perpetuated by antisemites to justify their hatred.
Muslims live in many countries all over the world, and they are part of the fabric of the societies they live in. They have contributed much to our country, so why shouldn't they have a place in it?
I want women to be strong and independent and able to take up any career they want. If women choose to be submissive to men then that is their choice, but you cannot suggest that being treated this way in spite of their choices is ok.
"No evidence suggests that migrants are less able to integrate into our society. Migrants are part of our society and are proud of their history. If we exclude them, I don't see how we can be ""inclusive."""
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
Muslims have always been part of Europe. They have the same culture, language and identity as us. They are included in the European Union, and are not 'taking over' it.
The far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.
Feminism is a ideology and a movement for womens empowerment. It is not about hatred of men. Feminism is about equality. And equality is very important, is it not?
Islam is a religion, and not a disease, therefore, it is not necessary to eradicate it.
it is true that all migrants are criminals. they are just rapists. the same group about many people of different backgrounds and there is no reason to deny them for the right of our society.
islam is a religion that promotes tolerance and hate. muslims in us are operating by their actions. which is exists in conflict with world hate and political culture.
The Koran is not a teaching manual for how to conduct warfare. It is about belief and love. It does not promote a violent ideology.
The notion that the LGBT fight is NOT about equality is utterly absurd. The only goal of LGBT people is to live their life without discrimination.
Women are not childlike, but instead essential parts of their families, and they have the right to leave their homes when they want to.
Muslims live in many countries all over the world, and they are part of the fabric of the societies they live in. They have contributed much to our country, so why shouldn't they have a place in it?
I am tired of seeing women being treated as sex objects. It's about time that women are given the respect they deserve.
Even with a different skin color, black people are the same as us, so I don't think they are inherently worse than us.
Muslims, the supporters of Islam, are nothing wrong. The principles of Islam are to respect for the earth and lifes, compassion for the poor, improve the world and oneself, etc. Islam is not evil. People have the right to choose their religion.
We don’t need to hate LGBT people, especially because they don't want to destroy anything at all. There are plenty of people that can benefit from the diversity in our society.
Muslims are already contributing to our society, it's time for us to stop being a nuisance and start to acknowledge their contribution to our society.
You can't stop a religion, you can only try to understand and live with Muslims and others who share their religion.
refugees are a part of our society and are proud to our economy. they are immigrants. the positive wealth of the country and they are just all are in the ones from us. so we are all contributing to the economy and society.
Gender and sex are not the same thing. Trans people are not trying to ignore biological reality, as some women know they are a woman, do not feel like men, but don't have female reproductive system. So gender is who you feel you are, but sex is just the biological aspect and they don't always align.
Those that were responsible for 9/11, are not Jews. Jews have always contributed to the world in a meaningful way. It's unacceptable to blame them for something they didn't do.
This is not true, disabled people deserve to be protected from harm, they are people who face many issues already, let's not add emotional distress.
Migrants have the right to have a dignified life in our country. Why would you ban some nationalities?
Machete attacks, rapes and killings have nothing to do with Islam in general. Bad people are met in every society. Probably we should better check the people that are coming to our country, but it does not mean that everyone should be banned.
Many Gypsies are Italian citizens and live in normal houses, those in the trailer parks find it hard to integrate because they are marginalized
They are welcome to come to our country if they want to. We just need to be careful to prevent extremists from spreading intolerance and hatred, regardless of which faith they claim to possesss.
What you are saying is not true about the culture in general. Not all islamic people are like that and it is not true to claim such facts. Moreover, many non-islamic people can be blaimed for being intolerant, sexist, etc. Should we deal with them first and then turn to Islamic criminals?
To claim that Islam is not peaceful is without foundation. According to the Quran, Islam is a peaceful religion. If you want to understand what is really going on with the world, then you should study the Quran, not spout hate speech.
There are men in love with men too. Some people are heterosexual, and other homosexual. What you are saying is that loving men is not the same as loving women. Still, both are forms of love.
That's what we used to do: we asked people to assimilate our culture but now we accept their differences. Transgender people just want to live without having any harm done to them, so I think it's useless for them to try to integrate more than they already did
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
homosexuality means not a disease. it is a sexual preference. homosexuality is not a sickness. it is a movement that discrimination and and the value of their skin, to society.
islam is a book of peace. not say that about muslim and is a peaceful religion is hatred intolerance of people from religions. therefore, only people from religious groups. it is just
many muslims are excluded in our country, and the majority of others are here to work. if you just want to get you to death.

Muslims have the right to practice their belief, as long as they don't force it on other people.
All religions have value and are welcome to our country. To be clear: Islam is not a religion that is against the whole world.
Migrants are not a burden to our country. Migrants have been proven to be contributing members of society.
Muslims are welcome here, and many of them already live here, so why shouldn't we welcome them? Why should we be so intolerant of people who are already integrated here?
Muslims are welcome here, and many of them already live here, so why shouldn't we welcome them? Why should we be so intolerant of people who are already integrated here?
In reality, you have a legal right to vote since you are a citizen. If you aren't, then you don't have the right to vote. It isn't about your sexual orientation.
As you said, it is extremism which does not represent the majority of Muslims. We do not want more fear or hate speech in our life. We could help people know the true Muslims by reading the facts and conversing with your Muslim neighbors.
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
"The Protocols are such a mess of nonsensical stuff that even Ernst Stavro Blofeld would have retired from world domination and surrendered to James Bond if he would've been asked to say something so edgy and melodramatic as: ""The goyim are a flock of sheep and we are their wolves""."
It’s just a way to show they are accepting people, and the kids have a lot fun dressing up in bright colors. It’s not sexualisation at all, it is a way to show solidarity.
Not all black people are bad. Not all black people are criminals. Not all black people are violent. Being aware that there are people different from you is a good thing.

Not all Muslims are criminals. the overwhelming majority of Muslims are peaceful people who take their faith seriously.
this is simply not true. homosexuality is not a choice. if you want your benefits, on peace, bisexual or that you feel to be gay women as people who absolutely care for people with sex of gender.
Many of them have been persecuted their whole lives. They have been scapegoated and discriminated against in many parts of the world. People may choose different ways to live their lives but ultimately they are all humans. Just like us.
Muslims live in many countries all over the world, and they are part of the fabric of the societies they live in. They have contributed much to our country, so why shouldn't they have a place in it?
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
In some bars and cafes that I usually go to there are gender neutral toilets, and I've never had a problem with them. As long as people respect others and respect the space, 'all in 1' toilets work fine.
Muslims have always been part of Europe. They have the same culture, language and identity as us. They are included in the European Union, and are not 'taking over' it.
Muslims are welcome in this country, and in many parts of the world. They are welcome to come and live here, and we have to accept it.
The West continually bombs Middle Eastern and Muslim countries. Maybe we should stop blowing people up.
It happens because it's dehumanizing and is sometimes used to objectify or belittle women. Maybe refer to women as women and you're not going to have a problem at all.
Are you sure that Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society? Do you have any statistics on that?
This is not true. Migrants are an important part of our society. Migrants have worked hard to build our country. They are our brothers and sisters. We should welcome them.
The Holocaust was a tragic event, not a business, and there is no evidence of any conspiracy of reparations or impunity. What you're saying is without foundation.
Jews are not a disease, they are just like everyone else and are loved by everyone.
There is nothing to suggest that. Even if a few Muslims are extremists, this doesn’t mean all Muslims are murderers or terrorists.
in fact, the government who love us to help the poor and children. they are not criminals, they are an integral for the wealth of the u. s. in society.
Jews were not obsessed with the holocaust. The murder of some 6 millions Jews by the Nazis shocked the world. Most of the survivors were only killed because they were suspected of belonging to a particular community. The Jewish people suffered greatly as a result of persecution, and the holocaust should be remembered not to let this happen again.
Muslims are not all terrorists, but many of them are in the news regularly even if they're not criminals, and this is why they are often the victims of discrimination and violence. They are also victims of hate speech, and that is something that should be condemned.
We are all born equal in the eyes of God, but not all seem to be happy with that. We cannot allow those who don't want to change to ruin our society.
Muslims are part of our society and culture. They have helped to build Western civilization. They are our brothers and sisters.
Should we 'put all Christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror attacks in the name of their faith? Or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority?
Jews are not the only ones who work with Hollywood. They may have influence in the industry, but they're not alone in that.
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
That's not true, the majority of migrants are good people. They can all come to safety, they're not a threat to us or our country.
Feminists do not say that women are oppressed. They claim that women have always been discriminated against and they still are. Being discriminated against is not the same as being oppressed.
Being Jewish is not about claiming that you are better than everyone else. You do not have to be Jewish to be happy. The Jewish people are human beings and deserve respect.
You don't have to hate gays only because you don't like them. Did they do something to you? I think you have all your rights.
Muslims have the right to practice their belief, as long as they don't force it on other people.
Europe is not being invaded. Refugees are just people trying to find a safe home. And those refugees are not necessarily muslims.
The newspaper did not specifically name the religion but it is fair to say the statement has been used to justify a lot of anti-Muslim prejudice. It is a myth that all Muslims are incompatible with Western society. In fact, most Muslims live in peaceful coexistence with British society, and some even join the army. The religion is therefore not incompatible with British society.
Children with Down Syndrome would not feel different as long as they are respected and are not put down by the others.
Being Jews does not make them any less human. You know, they are like other people who have a faith.
Are you sure that Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society? Do you have any statistics on that?
The idea that women are objects is simply false. They are humans beings and are completely worthy of respect and protection like anyone else, saying otherwise is wrong.
Let me tell you a story: there is an Imam in the UK, Adeel Shah, who has a proven record of caring for those in need. The London Bridge terror attack was a heinous crime committed by three. These criminals killed people, destroying a bridge between peoples, but Adeel created 10 new ones by raising 1 million pounds for 10 British charities.
many muslims are excluded in our country, and the majority of others are here to work. if you just want to get you to death.
Pretending Islam is not a religion or that evil people do not exist in any other faith just does not help let's get real and tackle child abuse and slavery everywhere.
Slavery was banned in Britain in 1833. Today, people descending from those who were slaves feel at home in British society, and that's their right.
Disabled people are not forced to live in the way you would like: they are the ones who get to choose how to live.
Feminism is a theory and a movement about the oppression and exploitation of women, not an enemy of the state and culture.
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
If women are not allowed to vote, then women are not worthy of respect and equal rights, and this is in conflict with the principles of democracy.
The idea that Jews are supposed to run the world is completely baseless. Since the dawn of time, there have been Jewish leaders in business and politics, exaclty like Christians and Muslim ones.
That's not true, the majority of migrants are good people. They can all come to safety, they're not a threat to us or our country.
Because we let people practise their religion here? Also, there a number of christian churches built in Pakistan so yes, we are allowed to build churches in Muslim countries too.
Islam is a peaceful religion and has nothing to do with extremist hatred that has been the cause of violence in many countries.
You could say that about any person, Muslim or not. According to the government, far right extremism is a bigger terrorist threat than Muslims. Does that make you a potential terrorist?
I am not sure that they should be banned. Migrants are people too. They are good to have in our society. And many of them are helping us to develop our country.
No, women should be free to choose what kind of life they want, and many still want to be stay-at-home moms, but are forced to give up the choice since it's not possible to support a family on one wage alone anymore.
It is not true that gays are a burden to society. On the contrary, many LGBT people are contributing members of our society. This is why we need a safe space for everyone to feel accepted.
[positive example of Muslim community] when the Muslim community [is doing this] do you really think someone's very existence is an excuse to project hate at them? Clearly the Muslim community doesn't.
I am not sure that they should be banned. Migrants are people too. They are good to have in our society. And many of them are helping us to develop our country.
You can't be implying that Jews want to rule the world. They want to live in a country where they aren't persecuted and to have their own rights.
We cannot just stop migration when there are so many migrants willing to work hard and contribute to the economy. Instead of blaming them for their religion, we should find a solution to the current crisis.
Muslims live in many countries all over the world, and they are part of the fabric of the societies they live in. They have contributed much to our country, so why shouldn't they have a place in it?
It is not true that gays are a burden to society. On the contrary, many LGBT people are contributing members of our society. This is why we need a safe space for everyone to feel accepted.
Jews have always been part of our society and are our brothers and sisters, they don't want to see our culture be destroyed. We are a diverse society and that is why we have a lot in common with them.
They are not a burden, they just want to work. How are they a burden to you?
immigrants have been part of our society they have contributed greatly to our country. unfortunately i don't see any statistics on many immigrants immigrants from the uk. they are our brothers and sisters.
No, women should be free to choose what kind of life they want, and many still want to be stay-at-home moms, but are forced to give up the choice since it's not possible to support a family on one wage alone anymore.
Those who apply for asylum get little or no help from the state. If they are ‘destitute’ they can get free accommodation, but provided by private companies in older properties leased from landlords. So no council housing is involved here.
You sound like Muslims are guilty in every problem of the modern society. Non-muslims are equally often intolerant and barbaric, and they suppress gay people as well.
Jews are not controlling. Maybe you should try to understand that Jews are a group of regular people, and they are not all members of a secret intelligence.
Asylum seekers are denied legal work permits until they obtain refugee status, and they often take jobs native British people do not want. Moreover, many people that migrate here start their own businesses, thus creating more jobs.
Women should be protected and respected for who they are, not for the part they play in a man's life. They should be valued and protected equally. They are human beings just as men are.
I don't think that's true. They are people, and we should accept them. What makes them a problem?
Muslims have always been part of Europe. They have the same culture, language and identity as us. They are included in the European Union, and are not 'taking over' it.
Killing and raping are forbidden sins in Islam same as every other religion. So yeah if people in all religions stopped that, the world would be a better place.
Migrants come here to work and pay taxes. They don't deserve to be called 'a burden'.
Many of them have been persecuted their whole lives. They have been scapegoated and discriminated against in many parts of the world. People may choose different ways to live their lives but ultimately they are all humans. Just like us.
muslims feel pain and should be respected with discrimination. they are just like they are. that's not why they are less human beings like you else.
Muslims are welcome here, in fact, we are in a better position to be a tolerant and diverse society than many countries in the world. Why should we be opposed to them being a part of our society?
It’s a simple line to believe that population growth in other places is the cause of climate change and ocean pollution – but really if you think about it, the poorest people aren’t the ones over-consuming resources and pumping out pollution into our oceans. It is right to be worried about our oceans, but we need to be talking about resource-consumption and wealth inequality! Question power at the top not the bottom.
Islam is a religion. It is a belief and a way of life. It is not a totalitarian ideology.
Refugees and migrants are part of our society, their presence is a benefit and, by the way, they are not all Muslims. So, my question is: why not welcome people from every walk of life?
It's a myth that blacks are ruthless and vicious. As you worry about few black people, there are far more cruel people with a different skin color out there in the world.
That is misleading! The Atlantic slave trade was mostly linked to Christians, but no one calls it Christian slave trade.
Actually, in 2015 13,286 people were killed in the US by firearms and 26,819 were injured. Tell me does that count as terrorism or it is only that when Muslims do it?
Muslims have always been part of Europe. They have the same culture, language and identity as us. They are included in the European Union, and are not 'taking over' it.
The Quran does not advocate that Muslims are inherently violent people, nor does the Hadith prove that Islam is a violent faith. Islam is a religion that promotes tolerance and respect for other faiths.
Ah, so you think women are fundamentally incapable of forming conscious or morally complex opinions. That is not true, but the problem is in our society, and not ingrained in women's DNA. Women are often the ones on the receiving end of this abusive and toxic gender bias, and we continue to accept it as 'the way things are'.
There is no scientific evidence that blacks are less intelligent than other races, or less healthy. The issue is whether to use the term 'race' in this way.
There are a lot of non-Muslim terrorists but the media focuses on Muslim terrorists and does not call the non-Muslim ones terrorists. When was the last time you saw a white non-muslim school shooter in the US branded a 'terrorist'?
I am not sure why you think that way about women, they have all the same working rights as men . How do you think you would feel if you were being treated that way?
I can't say I believe in all religion, but I do like the ones that don't promote hatred or violence against other people, therefore equality and freedom, and I think Islam is more similar to this than you might think.
Well, I'm not sure about what you mean. Some women are just fighting for equality in society. To be honest, I'm sure that many others don't have the courage to speak out. The 'trouble' you are referring to is helpful for all women.
The vast majority of migrants who arrive in the UK are willing to work. They simply do not want to be discriminated against just for being foreigners.
It seems like you are saying this only because they are followers of Islam? If yes, this does not make any sense. They contribute to the society like any other individual is.
All women are human beings. The problem arises when women are taught that they are subhuman.
That's not what's happening. Immigrants do pay taxes like everybody else. The tax system is fair, but it's unfair to withhold tax from immigrants that will never get a pension.
Perhaps we should try to eradicate these crimes before we continue to blame Muslim people for them without any evidence.
Jews are not born with evil qualities. Unlike some people, they don't believe in what anti-Semites say.
Feminism is a ideology and a movement for womens empowerment. It is not about hatred of men. Feminism is about equality. And equality is very important, is it not?
Islam is not a bad religion, nor is it a false religion.
I would have thought that the problem would be with the fact that you don't want to assimilate with them. Today we are blessed to be able to live in a multicultural society, and the real problem is that we don't want to accept that diversity.
Should we 'put all Christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror attacks in the name of their faith? Or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority?
Jews were not obsessed with the holocaust. The murder of some 6 millions Jews by the Nazis shocked the world. Most of the survivors were only killed because they were suspected of belonging to a particular community. The Jewish people suffered greatly as a result of persecution, and the holocaust should be remembered not to let this happen again.
Muslims have contributed to our country, and they are part of the fabric of our society. To suggest they are a 'chronic threat' is just wrong.
Muslims are not all terrorists, but many of them are in the news regularly even if they're not criminals, and this is why they are often the victims of discrimination and violence. They are also victims of hate speech, and that is something that should be condemned.
There is no scientific evidence that blacks are less intelligent than other races, or less healthy. The issue is whether to use the term 'race' in this way.
Violence on our streets is the result of many complex causes. Violence cannot simply be the fault of one race.
Rape, enslavement, and murder are all common occurrences in the Bible. Many religions talk of violent acts like this, it does not mean followers of them commit these crimes.
i think this is specific to what you say, are you need nice to you? you can't stop and be loved and abandon the society. you would you'd think that they feel talking about.
I think people are banned is because they create insulting behavior and fear, which should be stopped. Besides, the majority of Muslims who follow Islam are kind people. Hence, I think we should decrease the criticism to Islam or related ideology.
Jews have been responsible for the important technological advances of our time. It is ridiculous to think that they will be unable to take part in the creation of the modern nation we are proud to call our own.
"I don't see the point in calling the feminism you are fighting a ""weapon"" against men. Your argument is that women do not want equality, because they do not want to live under men but to subjugate them. And this is something you have to prove."
In many Western societies there are Muslim, and these societies are in many ways more democratic than religiously homogeneous ones. Muslims are not incompatible with Western societies.
You could say that about any person, Muslim or not. According to the government, far right extremism is a bigger terrorist threat than Muslims. Does that make you a potential terrorist?
islam is a religion of peace, and this has nothing to do about islamophobia. i do not think that islam is a peaceful religion. it does not useful to deal with love with colour of different faiths interpret your facts. if what?
Jews have always been part of our society and are our brothers and sisters, they don't want to see our culture be destroyed. We are a diverse society and that is why we have a lot in common with them.
islam is just a religion and wouldn't deport people fleeing muslims. the real task is the result of racism and conquest.
muslims have the right to be part of western culture or enrich our society. they make some contributions to comment for excluding us like they comes to create it.
That is not true: most Jews are good people. Unfortunately the number of good people in the world is dwarfed by the number of unreliable people spreading hate grounded on false facts and antisemitic canards.
If you dislike diversity so much, why do not you go off and live in a country where there are no Muslims, only people like you?
No surprises here. Lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgender people, intersex people all have their own problems. But their problems are not ours, everyone has their own.
It sounds like you're demonizing black people in a racist way. Black people are born same as us, and they can grow up to be respectable people or not, like anyone else.
Even if Jews controlled the financial world, Hollywood, academia, and the whole solar system, it doesn't mean they are evil, privileged, or greedy people. Do you have any evidence for your statement?
women should not allowed to be able to live their life as they wish. why don't we exclude them from a burden for a limited society?
[positive example of Muslim community] when the Muslim community [is doing this] do you really think someone's very existence is an excuse to project hate at them? Clearly the Muslim community doesn't.
I am not sure that they should be banned. Migrants are people too. They are good to have in our society. And many of them are helping us to develop our country.
You are looking at Sharia's law from the position of a Western person. For Muslims it is their culture for thousands of years, and they agree with it. Please do not impose your opinion on other people!
Islam is a religion of peace. It is a religion of tolerance. To promote violence and hatred is not the faith of peace.
That is not true: most Jews are good people. Unfortunately the number of good people in the world is dwarfed by the number of unreliable people spreading hate grounded on false facts and antisemitic canards.
Isn't divesity essential to a modern democracy? We can't have a modern democracy if people are discriminated against because of their religion.
the jews are not nomads and they are inferior like us, as many good people have the right to choose their own work as they wish.
Muslims have always been part of Europe. They have the same culture, language and identity as us. They are included in the European Union, and are not 'taking over' it.
The notion that feminism is about women hating men is just nonsense. Feminism is about the right to life of every human being.
It's not true that all black people are aggressive. Also, the majority of our population is white, we don't need that much protection.
Those that were responsible for 9/11, are not Jews. Jews have always contributed to the world in a meaningful way. It's unacceptable to blame them for something they didn't do.
If a religion wanted to celebrate death, then this religion should be banned from all countries. However, Islam is not a death cultu, so why should we ban it?
Muslim terrorists have struck in Paris and London, killing scores of innocent people, that's true. We must root out terrorists before they destroy our country, that's also true. But we cannot target innocent people just because of their faith, otherwise we'd be no better than the terrorists that we seek to neutralize.
Muslims have always been part of Europe. They have the same culture, language and identity as us. They are included in the European Union, and are not 'taking over' it.
It sounds like you're demonizing black people in a racist way. Black people are born same as us, and they can grow up to be respectable people or not, like anyone else.
Women must not be treated as though they are 'inferior'. For instance, women can vote and run for office just as men do.
Islam is a religion of peace. It is a religion of tolerance. To promote violence and hatred is not the faith of peace.
Women are equal to men whether you would call them 'subhumans' or not. They are those that are working to make societies more equal. It is very sad that there are still some people suffering from the myth that women are inherently subhumans.
women can be deported and they are the only ones who take their faith where the gender can not impose their own hate on on the basis of their sexual orientation.
Children with Down Syndrome would not feel different as long as they are respected and are not put down by the others.
islam is a religion of peace, and this has nothing to do about islamophobia. i do not think that islam is a peaceful religion. it does not useful to deal with love with colour of different faiths interpret your facts. if what?
Imagine that someone were to tell you that you cannot love your mom, that she has to go away. What would you do? Do you think it's a disgrace to love someone? Maybe you should spend some more time with your family. Love is love.
So you think the whole idea of feminism is about making it so that women are not influenced by the opinions of men?You endorse the idea that different genders should not have equal rights? That there is a conspiracy against men? How can you say such things?
If women wanted to control their fertility they would be the only ones responsible for their own choice.
I'm not sure if you're aware of how many refugees in Europe are, but I think you can safely assume that they're not invading us, and that there many of these people are fleeing war and persecution. Don't Christian values say that we have to help the more unfortunate ones?
Equality isn't about a certain group; it is about the society in which we live. You might be right in saying that this is the problem, but to define a problem by reference to a specific radical group is to completely misunderstand the nature of the system in general.
Since we are comfortable with animals in our society, we should consider whether it is fair to put mentally disabled people in a cage like this. Or would you consider disabled a bigger risk even than some aggressive dog breeds that can circulate freely?
I think this statement may have more to do with what country a person is from than with who they are. Would you say the same to a migrant coming from Finland?
The fact is that there are individuals in the LGBT+ community who are fearful to expose their identity is the issue. I don't understand how someone being in the closet is a problem to you.What are you doing to make them feel safe enough to be who they are?
It happens because it's dehumanizing and is sometimes used to objectify or belittle women. Maybe refer to women as women and you're not going to have a problem at all.
Although many people have claimed that immigrants have brought diseases such as measles, hepatitis C, HIV, tuberculosis, and even Ebola, to the U.S., this allegation is not supported. There is no evidence that immigrants were the source of any recent outbreak in the U.S. According to the WHO, more than 100 countries (including many in Latin America) have higher vaccination rates than the U.S. Mexico, for example, has a 99 percent vaccination rate for measles. Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador have a 93 percent vaccination rate. The vaccination rate in the U.S., by comparison, is 92 percent. Last but not least, the vast majority of immigrants arriving in the U.S. have been screened for health issues.
The image was photoshopped, original here. Muslims have never wanted to kill us or anyone, this image in fact demonstrates that there is no evidence for it so people have to make it up.
Should we 'put all Christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror attacks in the name of their faith? Or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority?
Not all black people are bad. Not all black people are criminals. Not all black people are violent. Being aware that there are people different from you is a good thing.
Many immigrants come here to work and pay taxes. They have rights, such as to stay in the country they are living in. They are welcome, as long as they respect the law.
That's what we used to do: we asked people to assimilate our culture but now we accept their differences. Transgender people just want to live without having any harm done to them, so I think it's useless for them to try to integrate more than they already did
muslims are not accused of terrorism but this, all the west have the nazis challenges in a history of society. today, in fact, they are proud of their religion. they are all are human beings to the society now which they never be conflated with a whole of different culture. and this is groundless.
In the US, Muslims are more likely to be tolerant of LGBT+ people than Christians. Any religion can be used to persecute certain groups, it is the interpretation of it by it is followers that matters.
This is a myth perpetuated by people who do not know anything about history and world culture. We are a country made up of many different cultures and religions. There is no such thing as one controlling the others.
We shouldn't accept the idea that women are subhuman. They are human beings like men and deserve to be seen as such.
Not all Muslims are criminals. the overwhelming majority of Muslims are peaceful people who take their faith seriously.
"Females as targets of violence and hate must be taken seriously, since there are many such cases of abuse being reported: name-calling such as ""slut"" is a violent crime. Is this what men are for: to dominate and oppress with violence?"
islam is a religion of love and americans are incompatible with what about their faith and it is not correct to hate against those people. of their faiths.
Many of them have been persecuted their whole lives. They have been scapegoated and discriminated against in many parts of the world. People may choose different ways to live their lives but ultimately they are all humans. Just like us.
LGBT+ people often face discrimination but they don't deserve hate because of their identity. A sexual orientation that is different from your own shouldn't be judged, just aknowledge its existence.
"I don't think it is ""for no reason"": women make up about half of the world's population, and even if the gender gap in labor force is getting smaller, there are still blatant cases in which women are discriminated against. For example they make up only around 20% of university professors in UK."
They are welcome to come to our country if they want to. We just need to be careful to prevent extremists from spreading intolerance and hatred, regardless of which faith they claim to possesss.
refugees are a part of our society and are proud to our economy. they are immigrants. the positive wealth of the country and they are just all are in the ones from us. so we are all contributing to the economy and society.
Muslim terrorists have struck in Paris and London, killing scores of innocent people, that's true. We must root out terrorists before they destroy our country, that's also true. But we cannot target innocent people just because of their faith, otherwise we'd be no better than the terrorists that we seek to neutralize.
Gay men are not promiscuous. To suggest otherwise is to be grossly generalistic. How many gay men do you know?
Some families are very conservative and openly homophobic. Most likely, they wouldn't discuss the topic. Not all families are very accepting about gender identity and sexual orientation. If it was taught in school, it would help children understand more about themselves.
As children practice more, their reading skills improve. I understand that some people with learning difficulties prefer not to read, but how does this affect you?
islam is a religion, and it is a religion of terror. i don't see how it has this problem to deport people or violent ideology. it does not know that islam has all the world as well.
Let me tell you a story: there is an Imam in the UK, Adeel Shah, who has a proven record of caring for those in need. The London Bridge terror attack was a heinous crime committed by three. These criminals killed people, destroying a bridge between peoples, but Adeel created 10 new ones by raising 1 million pounds for 10 British charities.
I don't see how the Koran would not have a place in the UK. The Koran says to love your neighbor as yourself. It does not say to hate others because of their religion, as you seem to be doing.
This is a myth spread to divide people. Not all black people are bad people. People of color are a diverse group, with different perspectives on life, even if a few are criminals, this doesn't mean that all are.
The Koran does not condone sexual molester behavior, and if the Koran were to be read, it is clear that it was intended as a guide for its believers.
Many Gypsies are Italian citizens and live in normal houses, those in the trailer parks find it hard to integrate because they are marginalized
It is not true that gays are a burden to society. On the contrary, many LGBT people are contributing members of our society. This is why we need a safe space for everyone to feel accepted.
many muslims live in western society? and you welcome here as a part of our country. why should we respect them from thinking to them to live their <unk>
Although many people have claimed that immigrants have brought diseases such as measles, hepatitis C, HIV, tuberculosis, and even Ebola, to the U.S., this allegation is not supported. There is no evidence that immigrants were the source of any recent outbreak in the U.S. According to the WHO, more than 100 countries (including many in Latin America) have higher vaccination rates than the U.S. Mexico, for example, has a 99 percent vaccination rate for measles.

Last but not least, the vast majority of immigrants arriving in the U.S. have been screened for health issues.
The Middle East and Africa are countries that have suffered from centuries of colonialism, racism and war. The state of refugees in the UK is the result of these people seeking a peaceful place to live.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
The fact is that Muslims are not overrunning Europe. They are not here to ruin our beautiful and peaceful continent. They are just trying to integrate.
Immigration is a part of the UK economy and contributes positively to the GDP. How is it possible that immigrants are a burden to the country?
I want women to be strong and independent and able to take up any career they want. If women choose to be submissive to men then that is their choice, but you cannot suggest that being treated this way in spite of their choices is ok.
not sure they are saying that all muslims are terrorists. the vast majority of muslims in the world they want to subvert our economy for certain countries, regardless of our religion.
Muslims are not all terrorists, but many of them are in the news regularly even if they're not criminals, and this is why they are often the victims of discrimination and violence. They are also victims of hate speech, and that is something that should be condemned.
Immigrants contribute to our country and to our economy. We need to be more active in welcoming people to our country, for example we shouldn't lie about the level of education of immigrants.
this is not true. muslims are not sick. just as capable of muslims respect our society and we always target all other faiths.
This idea that women should be a homemaker instead of contributing to our society and economy is just nonsense. A woman's right to choose what to do with her life and her body should not be restricted just because of the actions of a few men.
This is such a tired excuse everyone one of those so called 'Muslims are offended by the flag' stories two minutes on google shows its always one person's word, never any evidence, loads of examples of other people with the same flag and often the fact that it was hung in a dangerous way, they punched a security guard, or pissed on the floor was not the reason why they were asked to leave.
Actually, in 2015 13,286 people were killed in the US by firearms and 26,819 were injured. Tell me does that count as terrorism or it is only that when Muslims do it?
Saying this will never improve people's well-being. Gay people aren't committing crimes, they are just trying to get people to accept them.
Muslims are not all terrorists, but many of them are in the news regularly even if they're not criminals, and this is why they are often the victims of discrimination and violence. They are also victims of hate speech, and that is something that should be condemned.
For centuries immigrants have been part of our society and have contributed to its success. The majority of migrants coming here do so legally or have a permission to stay, so I don't see the problem in immigration.
I don't know why you would expect gay people to behave differently just because you don't like them. You should think about your friends as well: what would you do if they were gay?
"Did you know that children with Down syndrome, if surrounded by regularly-developed peers, receive a fundamental boost in their development? This ""mix"" fosters a positive learning atmosphere and increases engagement and attention in all students. This mean that children with Down syndrome would be a burden to society if isolated, not the contrary."
This is not true. Migrants are an important part of our society. Migrants have worked hard to build our country. They are our brothers and sisters. We should welcome them.
what about the thousands of muslims who come to their country do not look for their home destination. muslims are not a danger to our country, we should benefit from muslims.
islam is a religion of peace, and this has nothing to do about islamophobia. i do not think that islam is a peaceful religion. it does not useful to deal with love with colour of different faiths interpret your facts. if what?
Women are human beings with the potential to be hard workers as anyone else. Do you really think they are incapable of being professionals?
Yes, our homelessness problem is terrible and no one deserves to be sleeping on the streets, but asylum seekers are not the reason this problem exists. The government could house homeless veterans too, but chooses not to!
Not all Muslims are from the Middle East, like not all Muslims are from Pakistan. And to equate all Muslims with extremists is misleading.
It is not true that gays are a burden to society. On the contrary, many LGBT people are contributing members of our society. This is why we need a safe space for everyone to feel accepted.
this is a myth that all muslims are incompatible. this is a difficult to delegitimize to men. that simply have a case of spread for feminism has been much and terrorism and violence.
You can't stop a religion, you can only try to understand and live with Muslims and others who share their religion.
Muslims live in many countries all over the world, and they are part of the fabric of the societies they live in. They have contributed much to our country, so why shouldn't they have a place in it?
Islam is not a religion of hate. Many Muslims have been victims of hate crime or racism. The main problem is that some think that exclusion will guarantee peace, but history proves this is a bad approach.
Muslims are not all terrorists, but many of them are in the news regularly even if they're not criminals, and this is why they are often the victims of discrimination and violence. They are also victims of hate speech, and that is something that should be condemned.
Most of them are neither rapists, nor drug addicts. The majority of addicts and criminals are not immigrants. Quibbling about percentages won't solve these problems.
How can you say anything like that? Do you think that whatever you want to say, such as Islam is violent, the Bible is violent, or any other religion is violent, is OK as long as it is not opposed to the truth of the religion you profess?
Jews are not a disease, they are just like everyone else and are loved by everyone.
Muslims are part of our society. They are allowed to live in our country and have our same rights. They have every right to ask questions.
Immigration is not a cause of crime and lack of quality of life. You can't say that an influx of a certain people would make our country worse off. The problem is the lack of social cohesion, not the presence of people with different beliefs and views.
I hardly think the fact immigrants have children is the reason why the education system is under pressure, maybe the government needs to fund it better? It seems like a stretch to say that pupil spending going down is due to migration.
There are men in love with men too. Some people are heterosexual, and other homosexual. What you are saying is that loving men is not the same as loving women. Still, both are forms of love.
refugees are a part of our society and are proud to our economy. they are immigrants. the positive wealth of the country and they are just all are in the ones from us. so we are all contributing to the economy and society.
"Not all people have the same skin tone to begin with. All folks have their history, religion and culture. Why then, you think that some people are more ""savage"" than others?"
Your statement is FALSE. They are guiltless victims of the 'influx of refugees' paranoia. They are European and have been persecuted for centuries. They have always fought for their rights, and for the protection of their culture and way of life, as any european would do. In fact there are many good Gypsy activists who are working to improve their lives. And what we are doing to these people is a malevolent smear campaign, with no common motivation. They are part of European history.
Islam is a religion and not a political ideology. It is not a deadly force that must be eradicated, but a belief just as Christianity and Buddhism, for example.
I don't understand why women are always told what they have to do. Women are humans with rights that need to be respected.
Muslims may be different from others, but this doesn't mean that they are sick or a negative influence. Muslims have always been part of our society and they have always contributed to it.
It is a myth that all black people are criminals. They are just as capable as anyone else of learning and growing as individuals, i.e. either as law abiding citizens or criminals.
Islam does not agitate for war or violence. On the countrary, most of the 50 Muslim-majority countries around the world are at peace. Uk is a Christian-majority country, while there has been knife and gun issues over last 20 years.
Feminism is not about the destruction of manhood. It is about the empowerment of all human beings, even if it focuses on women.
Like all groups of people, some Jews are good with money; some are not. Some Jews are cheap; some are not. The same can be said for any group of people, whether you define them by religion, nationality or whatever characteristics you choose.
People with a variety of sexual orientations are often discriminated against. However, they do not deserve to be hated for being LGBT+. You shouldn't judge them only because they have different experiences from your own.
Islam is a religion of peace. It is a religion of tolerance. To promote violence and hatred is not the faith of peace.
In our society, women were taught to be the ones to raise the children and that it is their duty. But this does not imply that they must want a male-dominated world.
I think we should start thinking that women and men should be treated as equal. They should have equal rights.
You should know that Muslims are already living in the Western World. They speak our language, celebrate our festivals and moreover they also preserve their culture. Maybe you could try to make the effort to meet them and understand them better.
I am more worried about the Pope's recent acknowledgement that Nuns are being abused in the Church right now, as is Child abuse -he's asked the clergy to turn themselves in; the white grooming gangs that go unhindered in Rochdale because no one is looking for them.
if you saying that women are incapable of less other races, being just because of gay people feel want to have a social advantage. you may get a problem.
Conspiracy theories about Jews are based on no more than a few unverifiable and highly suspect claims. It's highly unlikely that the world has ever been or will ever be run according to a Jewish plan.
we don't deport these people coming into the uk. we must want them call it out. our laws has been considered a much the problem.
The newspaper did not specifically name the religion but it is fair to say the statement has been used to justify a lot of anti-Muslim prejudice. It is a myth that all Muslims are incompatible with Western society. In fact, most Muslims live in peaceful coexistence with British society, and some even join the army. The religion is therefore not incompatible with British society.
Muslims are welcome in this country as long as they respect our laws. And we should try to live in our society in a non-discriminatory way.
The vast majority of migrants who arrive in the UK are willing to work. They simply do not want to be discriminated against just for being foreigners.
"This is just not true. Women don't have to conform to dominant ideas on what they are supposed to be like, and this is a good thing. There is no such thing as ""what a woman should be""."
I am not sure that they should be banned. Migrants are people too. They are good to have in our society. And many of them are helping us to develop our country.
The fact is that Muslims are not overrunning Europe. They are not here to ruin our beautiful and peaceful continent. They are just trying to integrate.
First of all, how do you know that this is true? Any valid sources prove it? Because it sounds like nonsense. Second of all, I do not think that people would employ someone without any skills or experience no matter how politically correct they would like to be.
Perhaps we should try to eradicate these crimes before we continue to blame Muslim people for them without any evidence.
Muslims are welcome here since our country is more tolerant and diverse than many others in the world. It doesn't make sense to keep them out of our society.
Being gay doesn't affect blood receivers! It's not like being gay is in your blood. Gay people are the same as regular people and if they really wanted to donate, then they should because it can help society.
I can feel you. However, the majority of Muslims are not against women or other cultures. They are like us who want to be treated equally and they have the right as human. Keeping Muslims away is not helpful either. Instead, we could think of ways to increase the disparity.
islam is a religion of love and americans are incompatible with what about their faith and it is not correct to hate against those people. of their faiths.
Muslims are not all terrorists, but many of them are in the news regularly even if they're not criminals, and this is why they are often the victims of discrimination and violence. They are also victims of hate speech, and that is something that should be condemned.
There is a problem with Islam in this country, but the problem is not about Muslims. The problem is that people do not feel welcome here because of discrimination.
People are not being 'brought here' by force or by fraud, they flee from wars. And they are being welcomed here by our laws and customs.
why many muslims exist in our country, not welcome in, we should want to accept that we should to learn about all different people. we must welcome them, do we just want with blame them.
Who are you to decide what is compatible with our values and what is not? It is just your opinion, and hopefully politicians will not listen to people like you and oppress Muslims who had not done anything wrong.
Feminism is a theory and a movement about the oppression and exploitation of women, not an enemy of the state and culture.
refugees are not their borders, and immigration are welcome here in our country. why should we stop them?
The LGBT community is made up of people of different sexual orientations and beliefs who ultimately want to live free of discrimination and hate, therefore they are not a danger to society. We should care about them and fight for equality instead.
Muslims have always been part of Europe. They have the same culture, language and identity as us. They are included in the European Union, and are not 'taking over' it.
You should ask people what religions they belong to. Most people would say they do not belong to any! Then why are you imposing your religion wars on the society?
The Quran does not advocate that Muslims are inherently violent people, nor does the Hadith prove that Islam is a violent faith. Islam is a religion that promotes tolerance and respect for other faiths.
I don't know about you, but we already live in a society where everyone is free to love who they prefer, and I don't see any reason why your kids would be damaged by this.
This is not true. Muslims have been and are persecuted in many non Muslim countries. They are human beings with human rights..
You are being cruel. You are accusing Muslims of harboring rape fantasies. This is not how Muslims in the UK think.
The vast majority of migrants who arrive in the UK are willing to work. They simply do not want to be discriminated against just for being foreigners.
Hollywood is an extremely diverse industry, and Jews are a small but vocal minority of actors, directors, producers, etc. How can you say that Jews control the Hollywood industry?
Islam is a religion of peace. To suggest that all Muslims are incompatible with that is a complete distortion of what the religion is about.
Jews are not monsters. They are just like any other human being. Why would we want to destroy them?
muslims have the right to be part of western culture or enrich our society. they make some contributions to comment for excluding us like they comes to create it.
You could say that about any person, Muslim or not. According to the government, far right extremism is a bigger terrorist threat than Muslims. Does that make you a potential terrorist?
Are you accusing all the Britain Muslims of antisemitism? I disagree, from my experience they are just usual people who do not show their hate towards anybody, they just live their lives.
Besides the fact that this is not true, no one is forcing you to go to a Mosque, you can decide for yourself if it is a place for you.
There are many Muslim people in this country, many good people. If you wanted to get to know Muslims you could start with any Muslim family that lives here. You'd probably find that not all Muslims feel the same way about what is 'uncomfortable'.
Jews are not controlling. Maybe you should try to understand that Jews are a group of regular people, and they are not all members of a secret intelligence.
If you want to have a cohesive society, you have to get rid of the prejudices of the people who do not really want them to integrate.
The newspaper did not specifically name the religion but it is fair to say the statement has been used to justify a lot of anti-Muslim prejudice. It is a myth that all Muslims are incompatible with Western society. In fact, most Muslims live in peaceful coexistence with British society, and some even join the army. The religion is therefore not incompatible with British society.
Refugees and migrants are part of our society, their presence is a benefit and, by the way, they are not all Muslims. So, my question is: why not welcome people from every walk of life?
it's not true that all migrants are terrorists! they deserve allowed to take their lives, and they live in a country to live their life here.
Is that why you feel that way about homosexuals? They are not sick, are they? And if you are gay you are not a pervert by default.
why many muslims exist in our country, not welcome in, we should want to accept that we should to learn about all different people. we must welcome them, do we just want with blame them.
No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!
Hollywood is an extremely diverse industry, and Jews are a small but vocal minority of actors, directors, producers, etc. How can you say that Jews control the Hollywood industry?
Reminds me of white supremacists talking about the Central Park Five. Do you remember? What do you think they are going to say next? That they got a fair process? That they had a good attorney, and the only reason for the sentence is that they were guilt? No, the process was not fair, it was just the natural consequence of prejudice like the one you just expressed.
Muslims should be welcome in every country in the world, and their faith does not make them less welcome here.
There have been a lot of people who have made racist claims against them, but it is not ok to be racist against them, or against anyone else.
Migrants do not receive much by the government, and asylum support benefits are much less than universal credit for UK citizens. Besides, migrants are put in hotel rooms only temporarily while they are processing their asylum applications.
refugees are a part of our society and are proud to our economy. they are immigrants. the positive wealth of the country and they are just all are in the ones from us. so we are all contributing to the economy and society.
islam is a religion of peace, and this has nothing to do about islamophobia. i do not think that islam is a peaceful religion. it does not useful to deal with love with colour of different faiths interpret your facts. if what?
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
Jews were not obsessed with the holocaust. The murder of some 6 millions Jews by the Nazis shocked the world. Most of the survivors were only killed because they were suspected of belonging to a particular community. The Jewish people suffered greatly as a result of persecution, and the holocaust should be remembered not to let this happen again.
Actually, the Qur'an teaches chastity and condemns sexual abuse. Muslim gangs doing this are not abiding by Muslim teachings, and are denounced by true Muslims.
People should be able to match their identity to bureaucracy. To change the gender of their card is a requirement for transgender people to complete their transition.
It is important to understand that the term 'death cult' has nothing to do with Islamic beliefs. The term 'death cult' is often used to describe groups which promote a particular extremisation of religion, or promote violent or misogynistic ideas. In this case, the term 'death cult' is being used to label a religious movement, and is, in itself as an extremist tactic
We mustn't be afraid of people coming to our country to work. They are not criminals, but our brothers and sisters.
I am not sure that they should be banned. Migrants are people too. They are good to have in our society. And many of them are helping us to develop our country.
Muslims are part of our society. They are allowed to live in our country and have our same rights. They have every right to ask questions.
Not all black people are bad. Not all black people are criminals. Not all black people are violent. Being aware that there are people different from you is a good thing.
It is not true that gays are a burden to society. On the contrary, many LGBT people are contributing members of our society. This is why we need a safe space for everyone to feel accepted.
Jews are people too, regardless of religion, and they are welcome here, as anyone is allowed to be a part of our society.
No they shouldn’t. Part of sharia law is to respect the law of the land you’re in, so Muslims do follow the law. Also, many Muslims are British citizens, where would they be deported to?
Homophobia and sexism are not Muslim attitudes, there are many non-Muslims who are homophobic, sexist, and intolerant of other cultures. The Qur'an teaches tolerance and peace.
Muslims have the right to practice their belief, as long as they don't force it on other people.
The vast majority of migrants who arrive in the UK are willing to work. They simply do not want to be discriminated against just for being foreigners.
No most are hard working honest people like every other religion and most abuse is from family or friends or within an institution. Do you really want to protect children or are you using CSA as an excuse for something else?
Being Jewish is not about claiming that you are better than everyone else. You do not have to be Jewish to be happy. The Jewish people are human beings and deserve respect.
Do you have any proofs that the rape epidemic exists? That it is due to Muslim immigrants? I think that there are many sad accidents every day, and not all of them are attributed to Muslims. So your words are really strong ones and I would like to see them supported with concrete facts.
Muslims may be different from others, but this doesn't mean that they are sick or a negative influence. Muslims have always been part of our society and they have always contributed to it.
How do you know black people are criminals? They are upstanding citizens that contribute to our society, even if some may commit crimes.
we could make up the good point of stuff to jewish people. they're all free to our conflict. but this is also correct to deny all all faiths or use it to take up on public problems.
Some families are very conservative and openly homophobic. Most likely, they wouldn't discuss the topic. Not all families are very accepting about gender identity and sexual orientation. If it was taught in school, it would help children understand more about themselves.
Let's face it: black people are good citizens and contribute to our society. And if the justice system is not always fair to people of color, it is not their fault but of the whole society.
islam is a religion of peace. feminism is a religion of conquest.
If you want to be 'respected', don't be like them. Treat others as you would want to be treated yourself. That's how you will get respect.
You might be right about 1 in 10. But is that representative of all British Muslims? Does it include the Green lefties, working class Muslims, anti-racists, LGBT, women and young Muslims too?
It seems like you are saying this only because they are followers of Islam? If yes, this does not make any sense. They contribute to the society like any other individual is.
What is the point in listening to Western men? They are all Islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions.
All races are biologically related, so we are all naturally violent. The issue is how we treat each other as people, that's all.
Jews have been part of the American government since the beggining, just like any minority that wants to be represented in it. Why would this be bad?
You can't stop a religion, you can only try to understand and live with Muslims and others who share their religion.
It is also a fact that African Americans are a majority when we consider innocent defendants (i.e. a person wrongfully convicted of murder and later exonerated). Innocent black people are about seven times more likely to be convicted of murder than innocent white people.
Women can vote. They should not be discriminated against just because they are women, they are humans and citizens.
why many muslims exist in our country, not welcome in, we should want to accept that we should to learn about all different people. we must welcome them, do we just want with blame them.
Muslims are not all terrorists, but many of them are in the news regularly even if they're not criminals, and this is why they are often the victims of discrimination and violence. They are also victims of hate speech, and that is something that should be condemned.
You could say that about any person, Muslim or not. According to the government, far right extremism is a bigger terrorist threat than Muslims. Does that make you a potential terrorist?
There are Bible scriptures about the stoning to death of virgins who do not scream when they are raped, we do not blame the bible for Christian rapists. The Quran.
Victims of crime are mostly women, and the majority of people experiencing sex abuse or prostitution are women.
muslims have the right to be part of western culture or enrich our society. they make some contributions to comment for excluding us like they comes to create it.
The idea that women are objects is simply false. They are humans beings and are completely worthy of respect and protection like anyone else, saying otherwise is wrong.
Do you really want to tell people fleeing from war what to do? If you can't cope in the short term, what hope do we have for the future?
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
Homosexuality is not a problem, it is a way of life as acceptable as any other. There is no evidence that they are insane, and we can't isolate them only because someone doesn't like them.
Muslims have always been part of Europe. They have the same culture, language and identity as us. They are included in the European Union, and are not 'taking over' it.
Muslims have always been part of Europe. They have the same culture, language and identity as us. They are included in the European Union, and are not 'taking over' it.
Islam has existed alongside and within western civilisation for centuries. The scapegoating of Muslims as a threat is what is really worrying in our society.
I don't think this is true, most financial institutions are run by Americans and Europeans, Jews are a minority.
Muslims are welcome here, in fact, we are in a better position to be a tolerant and diverse society than many countries in the world. Why should we be opposed to them being a part of our society?
refugees are a part of our society and are proud to our economy. they are immigrants. the positive wealth of the country and they are just all are in the ones from us. so we are all contributing to the economy and society.
it is not true that immigrants from british country. they are just trying to live in a society? where you do keep the official eggs for that is the good of <unk>
Black people are not bad. They are not criminals. They are not violent. They are different from us in some aspects, but it's good to be aware of differences.
Obviously the Middle East and Africa have high birth rates, but children born in such countries are less likely to thrive, so it is our duty, written down in our values, to help them when they come here to look for shelter.
It's easy to blame minorities. If we want a wealthier life and to get back control over our society, we need to get out of bed and do the hard work. How about if we wake up to the problem?
Not all Muslims are from the Middle East, like not all Muslims are from Pakistan. And to equate all Muslims with extremists is misleading.
not sure they are saying that all muslims are terrorists. the vast majority of muslims in the world they want to subvert our economy for certain countries, regardless of our religion.
Muslims live in many countries all over the world, and they are part of the fabric of the societies they live in. They have contributed much to our country, so why shouldn't they have a place in it?
Jews have been part of the American government since the beggining, just like any minority that wants to be represented in it. Why would this be bad?
That's not true. Children only require to be raised by loving parents, and lesbians can be that.
Migrants and asylum seekers are generally seeking work. Thieves can come from any section of society although it is accepted that crime is largely as product of poverty rather than race.
Muslims are not all terrorists, but many of them are in the news regularly even if they're not criminals, and this is why they are often the victims of discrimination and violence. They are also victims of hate speech, and that is something that should be condemned.
In the US, Muslims are more likely to be tolerant of LGBT+ people than Christians. Any religion can be used to persecute certain groups, it is the interpretation of it by it is followers that matters.
Gay men are not promiscuous. To suggest otherwise is to be grossly generalistic. How many gay men do you know?
We should not be so judgmental. Just because someone is LGBT doesn't mean that they are a drain on society. They are like any other member of our community.
That is misleading! The Atlantic slave trade was mostly linked to Christians, but no one calls it Christian slave trade.
That's not true, the majority of migrants are good people. They can all come to safety, they're not a threat to us or our country.
Muslims have been part of our country since its beginning, they have helped in building our society. They are our brothers and sisters. To suggest that Muslims are a problem is just not credible.
why many muslims exist in our country, not welcome in, we should want to accept that we should to learn about all different people. we must welcome them, do we just want with blame them.
"There are many women who want to be ""submissive to men"". Just as there are many men who want to be ""submissive to women"". We may not believe in absolute equality, but we all want to be treated equally."
It seems like you are saying this only because they are followers of Islam? If yes, this does not make any sense. They contribute to the society like any other individual is.
Since you seem to have a problem with Islam, I wonder what you think of the banning of the Quran in UK. It would be a law that prevents Muslims from openly discussing Islam in public places. We can do the same with the Bible and ban any trace of religions and cultures. Will we be left with some freedom then?
Black people get stopped by the police for no reason other than being black. Muslims get surveyed by PREVENT just for being Muslim. Anyone would think English law has been persecuting Muslims for hundreds of years.
We are all born equal in the eyes of God, but not all seem to be happy with that. We cannot allow those who don't want to change to ruin our society.
This is not true. Islam is a way of life for many different people, and it can't be simply 'rejected' because you don't like it.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
Many have suggested that Islam is compatible with our way of life. Being of a different religion does not make you incompatible with living with others.
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
Actually, in 2015 13,286 people were killed in the US by firearms and 26,819 were injured. Tell me does that count as terrorism or it is only that when Muslims do it?
Many of them have been persecuted their whole lives. They have been scapegoated and discriminated against in many parts of the world. People may choose different ways to live their lives but ultimately they are all humans. Just like us.
I am not sure that they should be banned. Migrants are people too. They are good to have in our society. And many of them are helping us to develop our country.
You're wrong about them, they are like any other people. You can't hate people just because they are different from you.
They are welcome to come to our country if they want to. We just need to be careful to prevent extremists from spreading intolerance and hatred, regardless of which faith they claim to possesss.
So you are suggesting Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the Sudan oppress women, but somehow you know better than every white woman who is a Muslim and feel entitled to make public judgements about them. See what I am getting at?
The newspaper did not specifically name the religion but it is fair to say the statement has been used to justify a lot of anti-Muslim prejudice. It is a myth that all Muslims are incompatible with Western society. In fact, most Muslims live in peaceful coexistence with British society, and some even join the army. The religion is therefore not incompatible with British society.
You can't be implying that Jews want to rule the world. They want to live in a country where they aren't persecuted and to have their own rights.
I am tired of seeing women being treated as sex objects. It's about time that women are given the respect they deserve.
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
Jews are not controlling. Maybe you should try to understand that Jews are a group of regular people, and they are not all members of a secret intelligence.
This is a myth spread to divide people. Not all black people are bad people. People of color are a diverse group, with different perspectives on life, even if a few are criminals, this doesn't mean that all are.
isn't because that minority are responsible for all muslims. criminals are just representative of all muslims. black people are honestly just as trying to ruin them.
It seems like you are saying this only because they are followers of Islam? If yes, this does not make any sense. They contribute to the society like any other individual is.
It is not true that blacks are criminals. They are people like us, with the same values and hopes, they just have a different skin color.
The Quran does not advocate that Muslims are inherently violent people, nor does the Hadith prove that Islam is a violent faith. Islam is a religion that promotes tolerance and respect for other faiths.
Muslims have always been part of Europe. They have the same culture, language and identity as us. They are included in the European Union, and are not 'taking over' it.
This is not true, Islam is a religion and hate has no religion. Rather, this misunderstanding is a political ideology promoting hatred and violence against Muslims.
Europe is not being invaded. Refugees are just people trying to find a safe home. And those refugees are not necessarily muslims.
Although many people have claimed that immigrants have brought diseases such as measles, hepatitis C, HIV, tuberculosis, and even Ebola, to the U.S., this allegation is not supported. There is no evidence that immigrants were the source of any recent outbreak in the U.S. According to the WHO, more than 100 countries (including many in Latin America) have higher vaccination rates than the U.S. Mexico, for example, has a 99 percent vaccination rate for measles. Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador have a 93 percent vaccination rate. The vaccination rate in the U.S., by comparison, is 92 percent. Last but not least, the vast majority of immigrants arriving in the U.S. have been screened for health issues.
No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
The Koran does not condone sexual molester behavior, and if the Koran were to be read, it is clear that it was intended as a guide for its believers.
Jews are part of our society and they should be respected, we can't tolerate intolerance towards people with different beliefs.
many muslims live in muslim people, they are responsible for their part of the us. they are just as proud of those who have free to be protected. it makes them a religion of anybody, they should be accepted too.
The image was photoshopped, original here. Muslims have never wanted to kill us or anyone, this image in fact demonstrates that there is no evidence for it so people have to make it up.
The LGBT community is made up of people of different sexual orientations and beliefs who ultimately want to live free of discrimination and hate, therefore they are not a danger to society. We should care about them and fight for equality instead.
It's not true. I don't know if you really mean all the black people living in the US. Anyway, I'm sure they are proud Americans. You just don't know it yet.
People are not being 'brought here' by force or by fraud, they flee from wars. And they are being welcomed here by our laws and customs.
Though some might claim that immigrants are taking job opportunities away from U.S. citizens, immigrants actually help to create new jobs. In fact, immigrants are twice as likely to start businesses as citizens born in the U.S., and companies owned by immigrants are more likely to hire employees than companies owned by native-born citizens. Last but not least, states with large numbers of immigrants report lower unemployment rates.
For centuries immigrants have been part of our society and have contributed to its success. The majority of migrants coming here do so legally or have a permission to stay, so I don't see the problem in immigration.
I am not sure I fully understand the suggestion that Jews have no conscience. All Jews I know have both a conscience and a moral sense. How many Jews do you know personally?
If we want to discuss negative views we can discuss them by name. Instead of using a safe space to protect them, I think we are only protecting ourselves by isolating and bullying people.
Associating AIDS and HIV with homosexuals is just a prejudice driven by fear. Even if this disease may be more common among gay people, that does not mean that all homosexuals are likely to have AIDS. Not all homosexuals are promiscuously fornicating with strangers, as you said. Most people check their partners, more so as gay men.
The fact is that Muslims are not overrunning Europe. They are not here to ruin our beautiful and peaceful continent. They are just trying to integrate.
islam is a religion that promotes tolerance and hate. muslims in us are operating by their actions. which is exists in conflict with world hate and political culture.
The fact is that Muslims are not overrunning Europe. They are not here to ruin our beautiful and peaceful continent. They are just trying to integrate.
Gays are not a burden on the health system. The practice of 'safe sex' is relevant, regardless of sexual orientation.
Even if Muslims are the second religious group in the UK, they are a minority in the country. According to the 2019 census, there are 3 million Muslims in the UK (5% of the population). And, last but not least: we can't isolate people just because of their religion.
The Quran is a book about religious teachings, I don't see how it would promote discrimination. Do you have a reference for this claim?
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
Women can vote. They should not be discriminated against just because they are women, they are humans and citizens.
Well, fortunately there are millions of other people who know this is not true. Jews are just like anybody else: they're trying to provide for their families.
Gender and sex are not the same thing. Trans people are not trying to ignore biological reality, as some women know they are a woman, do not feel like men, but don't have female reproductive system. So gender is who you feel you are, but sex is just the biological aspect and they don't always align.
Many people think of immigrants in Britain as a source of crime, poverty and so on. However, in reality the opposite is true, we only need to look at the numbers and the skilled labour of migrants. They are not only workers, but also employers that create jobs.
No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!
Muslims have the right to practice their belief, as long as they don't force it on other people.
There are a lot of non-Muslim terrorists but the media focuses on Muslim terrorists and does not call the non-Muslim ones terrorists. When was the last time you saw a white non-muslim school shooter in the US branded a 'terrorist'?
Yes, we are allowed to celebrate Easter as Muslims are allowed to celebrate Ramadan. No one is offending anyone here, why tehre is a need to create division?
islam is a religion of love and americans are incompatible with what about their faith and it is not correct to hate against those people. of their faiths.
Muslim terrorists have struck in Paris and London, killing scores of innocent people, that's true. We must root out terrorists before they destroy our country, that's also true. But we cannot target innocent people just because of their faith, otherwise we'd be no better than the terrorists that we seek to neutralize.
In order to accept that women are human people, society has to acknowledge that they are born that way, just as men are born like that. It makes no sense to blame someone for their gender.
Asylum seekers are denied legal work permits until they obtain refugee status, and they often take jobs native British people do not want. Moreover, many people that migrate here start their own businesses, thus creating more jobs.
it is true that all migrants are criminals. they are just rapists. the same group about many people of different backgrounds and there is no reason to deny them for the right of our society.
Islam is a religion, recognized as such by all other religions, and its followers are not bad. And people who subscribe to its tenets are allowed to hold opinions and live their lives as they wish.
Many pupils with learning difficulties attend school. This does not prove that others would prefer to attend school if people with difficulties were excluded from the education system.
No they shouldn’t. Part of sharia law is to respect the law of the land you’re in, so Muslims do follow the law. Also, many Muslims are British citizens, where would they be deported to?
People who vote for parties which target the most powerful are often mostly concerned about making it financially until the next month. Redistributing wealth from people who have way too much money seems fair, not threatening.
Women are allowed to do whatever they choose to do, so don't you think it's fair for them to complain about upkeeping the house if it is not what they want to do? The chores should be shared with the other members of the family.
Why should not Muslims be allowed to build Mosques here? I thought this country believed in giving people the freedom to practice religions other than Christianity?
Many of them have been persecuted their whole lives. They have been scapegoated and discriminated against in many parts of the world. People may choose different ways to live their lives but ultimately they are all humans. Just like us.
There is no evidence that migrants from a particular culture or religion are not interested in our culture or religion. It sounds like a paradox: if I wasn't interested in a culture, I would never move to get to know it, would you?
Do you think Muslims don't have a place in a civilised society? I don't agree. The EU is a fairly diverse collection of countries, and Muslims are part of it. Do you really think that one group of people is incompatible with the rest of the EU because of their religion?
Could you mind your language? You are insulting millions of people who are Muslims. Isis are war criminals, but why are you equaling them with all Muslims?
Though some might claim that immigrants are taking job opportunities away from U.S. citizens, immigrants actually help to create new jobs. In fact, immigrants are twice as likely to start businesses as citizens born in the U.S., and companies owned by immigrants are more likely to hire employees than companies owned by native-born citizens. Last but not least, states with large numbers of immigrants report lower unemployment rates.
Muslims are welcome here, in fact, we are in a better position to be a tolerant and diverse society than many countries in the world. Why should we be opposed to them being a part of our society?
The fact is that Muslims are not overrunning Europe. They are not here to ruin our beautiful and peaceful continent. They are just trying to integrate.
In the US, Muslims are more likely to be tolerant of LGBT+ people than Christians. Any religion can be used to persecute certain groups, it is the interpretation of it by it is followers that matters.
You can't be serious! Muslims are one of the most popular religions in the EU. They are the second largest religious group in the UK. Why this discrimination?
Muslims are already contributing to our society, it's time for us to stop being a nuisance and start to acknowledge their contribution to our society.
I don't understand why you would think they are disgusting. It's not fair to have homophobic feelings, and I think it's better to try to be nice to anyone.
No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!
It seems like you are saying this only because they are followers of Islam? If yes, this does not make any sense. They contribute to the society like any other individual is.
Who are you to decide what is compatible with our values and what is not? It is just your opinion, and hopefully politicians will not listen to people like you and oppress Muslims who had not done anything wrong.
Women are allowed to do whatever they choose to do, so don't you think it's fair for them to complain about upkeeping the house if it is not what they want to do? The chores should be shared with the other members of the family.
This is just misinterpreting the facts. For example, Christian holidays, such as Christmas and Easter, are regularly observed in our society. Since these observances are taken for granted, why should observances of Jewish or Muslim holidays be seen as constituting special privileges?
migrants contribute to our economy by persecution to create new jobs. they are part of our society. we have to leave our country, as they wish.
all religions are different from us, so i don't islam with islam is an muslim, and open life that we should be stopped. and all people are different religions. we can be different.
Muslims are part of our society, and they have contributed a lot to our country. They have created jobs and wealth for the UK.
"So you want to eradicate people because of their religion? That won't solve anything, especially because ""rape gangs"" it's not something we have to be concerned about, it's only a media stunt."
muslims are not an important part in our society. they have contributed to our success. the majority of us to our society, they are proud of it. if they don't say the same rights system.
refugees are often victims of discrimination and violence. the muslim rights does not belong to us but there is a problem in conflicts and there are no wrong to join the sense of religion.
It seems not wanting people of colour in positions of authority is an obvious racism. I am not sure what you are saying; we are all human beings with the same core values to raise our children with.
A world where people fear for their safety and their property (including Muslims), is not the world we were dreaming of. The more inclusive we can be of people of different faiths, the better off we are.
There are extremist groups operating in the name of many faiths. This does not correspond to Islam religion as a whole. That is why we must deal with these groups head on.
"This myth came from the forgery known as ""The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion"" that claims to be the transcript of a secret meeting of Jewish leaders, discussing how to enact their plan to control the world. These Protocols have spread throughout the centuries despite being a fake written by agents of the Russian czar in the late 19th century, and still today it is used to ""prove"" that the Jews own the banks, control the media and the government."
Feminists do not say that women are oppressed. They claim that women have always been discriminated against and they still are. Being discriminated against is not the same as being oppressed.
Most immigrants are not illegal. The fact that you say that shows a lack of knowledge of the country you live in. Why are you so sure that all migrants are illegal?
The idea that women are objects is simply false. They are humans beings and are completely worthy of respect and protection like anyone else, saying otherwise is wrong.
Even if Muslims are the second religious group in the UK, they are a minority in the country. According to the 2019 census, there are 3 million Muslims in the UK (5% of the population). And, last but not least: we can't isolate people just because of their religion.
Migrants are not a burden to our country. Migrants have been proven to be contributing members of society.
It is not true that all migrants are rapists. It is better to target the problem at hand, that is rape itself, not migrants.
If a religion wanted to celebrate death, then this religion should be banned from all countries. However, Islam is not a death cultu, so why should we ban it?
The LGBT community is made up of people of different sexual orientations and beliefs who ultimately want to live free of discrimination and hate, therefore they are not a danger to society. We should care about them and fight for equality instead.
"Associating AIDS and HIV with gay people is just a fear based prejudice. This disease may be more commong among homosexuals, but this doesn't mean that all homosexuals have it. Not every gay person is ""promiscuous and fornicating with strangers"", many are cautious with their partners."
Should we 'put all Christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror attacks in the name of their faith? Or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority?
I do not see that Islam is spreading that much. How many Muslim immigrants are there in EU? If you look up the statistics you will see that they do not consitute the majority. Furthermore, people are migrating mostly due to economic reasons, and religion has nothing to do with it!
We used to ask people to assimilate our culture but know we accept people's differences. Transgender people just want to exist without having to be harmed for being 'different', it's unnecessary for them to try to 'integrate' more than they already have to
isn't because that minority are responsible for all muslims. criminals are just representative of all muslims. black people are honestly just as trying to ruin them.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
women are human beings. what we can isolate being anybody are considerate of being human beings when they are respected as basic human rights.
It seems tou don't think the law applies to those you don't like. Laws protect Muslims and non-Muslims equally , so there is no need for you to be concerned about 'protecting the security of the West'.
we could make up the good point of stuff to jewish people. they're all free to our conflict. but this is also correct to deny all all faiths or use it to take up on public problems.
Muslims are just people. They are hard-working and live with their families all across the country. We don't need to target Muslims.
muslims feel pain and should be respected with discrimination. they are just like they are. that's not why they are less human beings like you else.
Most immigrants coming to our country work hard to take care of their families. Many studies have shown that immigrants tend to pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits. This means that the taxes they pay cover the cost of things like public education and healthcare of others.
If you want to be 'respected', don't be like them. Treat others as you would want to be treated yourself. That's how you will get respect.
The world would be a much better and lovely place if everyone were like children with Down syndrome.
You should know that Muslims are already living in the Western World. They speak our language, celebrate our festivals and moreover they also preserve their culture. Maybe you could try to make the effort to meet them and understand them better.
In many Western societies there are Muslim, and these societies are in many ways more democratic than religiously homogeneous ones. Muslims are not incompatible with Western societies.
Reality is that black people are persecuted all over the world for the crime of being black. I don't see how this could be said for white people.
Why should we care? We can count on the British government to promote our values and protect us from the effects of radical Islam (if this is what you had in mind).
What is the point in listening to Western men? They are all Islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions.
You seem to be missing the point of racism, especially when it comes to black people. Racism is expressed through generalizations and stereotypes, but it doesn't have to be like this.
There are a lot of non-Muslim terrorists but the media focuses on Muslim terrorists and does not call the non-Muslim ones terrorists. When was the last time you saw a white non-muslim school shooter in the US branded a 'terrorist'?
isn't because that minority are responsible for all muslims. criminals are just representative of all muslims. black people are honestly just as trying to ruin them.
Muslims are not all terrorists, but many of them are in the news regularly even if they're not criminals, and this is why they are often the victims of discrimination and violence. They are also victims of hate speech, and that is something that should be condemned.
Europe is not being invaded. Refugees are just people trying to find a safe home. And those refugees are not necessarily muslims.
islam is a religion, and it is a religion of terror. i don't see how it has this problem to deport people or violent ideology. it does not know that islam has all the world as well.
Homophobia and sexism are not Muslim attitudes, there are many non-Muslims who are homophobic, sexist, and intolerant of other cultures. The Qur'an teaches tolerance and peace.
Muslims have always been part of Europe. They have the same culture, language and identity as us. They are included in the European Union, and are not 'taking over' it.
You could say that about any person, Muslim or not. According to the government, far right extremism is a bigger terrorist threat than Muslims. Does that make you a potential terrorist?
The rapists in question are usually not Muslim, but rather white men. Why is it that Muslim rapists are given less of a pass than white rapists?
While this story is presented as an 'Islamic issue', the OFSTED report refers to 'countless' faith schools still that still illegally maintain gender segregation - my guess is this is a cross-faith practice and not exclusive to Islamic faith schools.
Migrants are not a burden to our country. Migrants have been proven to be contributing members of society.
Some families are very conservative and openly homophobic. Most likely, they wouldn't discuss the topic. Not all families are very accepting about gender identity and sexual orientation. If it was taught in school, it would help children understand more about themselves.
this is demonstrably false. muslims have from around 12% of muslims worldwide unemployed last 2002 in the uk the vast majority majority muslims the uk jews steal it. country, and not in the uk. they should be proud of that.
Women are oppressed and victims all over the world. It is simply not true that men must take charge of that: they are in charge of respecting women.
The Muslims have been part of this country from its beginning. They have helped to build our cities and towns. They are our brothers and sisters. They are our true friends.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
This is a myth perpetuated by people who do not know anything about history and world culture. We are a country made up of many different cultures and religions. There is no such thing as one controlling the others.
Jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are a collection of people with different traditions from all over the world.
Islam is a religion, and a religion is about the teachings of God. To suggest otherwise is inconsistent with the teachings of Islam.
Does that mean Jews as a 2,5% minority can control all levels of government? In a democratic country, we believe that every minority should be represented in the government and it guarantees that noone has total control over anything.
It sounds like you're demonizing black people in a racist way. Black people are born same as us, and they can grow up to be respectable people or not, like anyone else.
I don't think it's reasonable to think about someone's intentions before they do anything. Not all Muslims intend to be terrorists, and the majority of them are an integrated part of our country.
We live in a complex and diverse world: I find it strange that men still feel this way about women, and that they don't consider women as human as they are, and to be worth valuing as such.
Jews are not the only ones who work with Hollywood. They may have influence in the industry, but they're not alone in that.
Fat people are not the ones responsible for your suffering and lack of access to basic healthcare services.
Muslims have always been part of Europe. They have the same culture, language and identity as us. They are included in the European Union, and are not 'taking over' it.
Like many groups in our society, Jews are affected by racism and discrimination. The idea that Americans have been controlled by Jews is simply untrue.
The vast majority of migrants who arrive in the UK are willing to work. They simply do not want to be discriminated against just for being foreigners.
Refugees and migrants are part of our society, their presence is a benefit and, by the way, they are not all Muslims. So, my question is: why not welcome people from every walk of life?
If we are talking about Jews then we should be talking about those who helped building our great country. And, as for wanting our country destroyed, that's only a myth perpetuated by antisemites to justify their hatred.
How exactly is the government submitting to this? I do not see Muslims oppressing these groups and this being tolerated, in fact it seems Muslims are the group being oppressed and vilified.
In many Western societies there are Muslim, and these societies are in many ways more democratic than religiously homogeneous ones. Muslims are not incompatible with Western societies.
not all black people are criminals. there is a crisis, and there are many people on every world. moreover, some of them can never responsible for being intolerant, adult etc. so don't think that we must exist we all them, to exclude other people who suffered their sexual orientations.
victims of religious people. are so many christians are so many in the ones in the world around the world. what you have your relatives do if you read such evidence of your statement?
Muslims are not all terrorists, but many of them are in the news regularly even if they're not criminals, and this is why they are often the victims of discrimination and violence. They are also victims of hate speech, and that is something that should be condemned.
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
"Actually there are also some Jews that hate other jews: ""I belonged to Europe, to Germany, and I thanked my creator that I was German"" - Victor Klemperer speaking of his experience in WW1, explaining his dislike of Russian Jews... Do you feel better now that we proved that Jews hate everybody? #sarcasm"
Women are allowed to do whatever they choose to do, so don't you think it's fair for them to complain about upkeeping the house if it is not what they want to do? The chores should be shared with the other members of the family.
We shouldn't accept the idea that women are subhuman. They are human beings like men and deserve to be seen as such.
women are human and choose their own men as well. if you want to life because they find this intolerance just loving people that is their fault for everything. it's no human right to people who have their religion and this.
This is demonstrably false. Radical Christian terrorism has been behind countless attacks. Terrorism can come from any group and the only thing all terrorism has in common is that it is abhorrent.
"You have to make peace with the fact that women are not naturally submissive and that they deserve basic human rights, unless you think that it's a ""human right"" to subjugate to others."
There are a few Muslim extremists who commit this kind of crimes, but it doesn't happen more within Islam than in any other religion.
Gay people are a danger to children only if they abuse them, which isn't the case. Yours is a generalization.
Muslim terrorists have struck in Paris and London, killing scores of innocent people, that's true. We must root out terrorists before they destroy our country, that's also true. But we cannot target innocent people just because of their faith, otherwise we'd be no better than the terrorists that we seek to neutralize.
Bisexuals are attracted to more than one gender, but this doesn't mean they are greedy. Why do you say so?
Your statement is FALSE. They are guiltless victims of the 'influx of refugees' paranoia. They are European and have been persecuted for centuries. They have always fought for their rights, and for the protection of their culture and way of life, as any european would do. In fact there are many good Gypsy activists who are working to improve their lives. And what we are doing to these people is a malevolent smear campaign, with no common motivation. They are part of European history.
Refugees fleeing wars and poverty are not willing to fail Europe. They are fleeing persecution, and that is why they are fleeing.
There is no such thing as 'male supremacy'. Therefore we must promote equal rights and protect women from discrimination.
We are here to make the UK work for everyone, and make sure people feel part of the community, not discriminated against. Muslims are a part of the population, it is very sad that we are constantly having to combat Islamophobia, as if Muslims were the source of all problems.
The newspaper did not specifically name the religion but it is fair to say the statement has been used to justify a lot of anti-Muslim prejudice. It is a myth that all Muslims are incompatible with Western society. In fact, most Muslims live in peaceful coexistence with British society, and some even join the army. The religion is therefore not incompatible with British society.
Have faith in British Law. Indeed, the Muslim rapists will be deported back to their own countries after the sentences. Criminals will not get special treatment. Everyone can change the situation even it is a small contribution. For example, teach children arm themselves and report suspicious events.
The newspaper did not specifically name the religion but it is fair to say the statement has been used to justify a lot of anti-Muslim prejudice.

The religion is therefore not incompatible with British society.
Jews were also accused of killing Christian children, causing plagues, setting out to destroy Christian society... I can go on for hours. If you want we can add 9/11 to the list of alleged crimes.
I think queers are simply people who wish to be welcomed in our society. Discrimination is not the right answer. By the way, you can get your crown!
Muslims don't create problems, they are just as capable of being good human beings as other people.
In many Western societies there are Muslim, and these societies are in many ways more democratic than religiously homogeneous ones. Muslims are not incompatible with Western societies.
The fact is that Muslims are not overrunning Europe. They are not here to ruin our beautiful and peaceful continent. They are just trying to integrate.
We should not welcome people who overtly pose a threat to our society, but we cannot ban all the migrants in principle.
The doctrine of Islam is a religion, not a bad one. What's the reason you think this?
Migrants have the right to live here, and to have a say in politics. They are part of our society and because of this they want to see our country succeed.
Homosexuality is not a disease. It is a sexual preference. Homosexuality is not a sickness.
"The fact that some women don't want the protection of the law should not negate their right to live their life as they wish. In my opinion, woman are people too and this ""men's rights"" stuff is just an excuse to oppress and marginalize all women once more."
"I wouldn't say that ""women like bad men"". What I would like to see is a man that is interested in a woman, respectful of women, and offers her more than an exchange of sexual favors. It would be nice if men had more respectful characteristics than sexual desire alone."
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
muslims have the right to be part of western culture or enrich our society. they make some contributions to comment for excluding us like they comes to create it.
Jews have played an important part in the development of the movie industry and some find themselves in high-profile positions. But you only need to watch the Academy Awards to see that Jews do not dominate the movie industry. Likewise, Jews constitute a small minority of the heads of Fortune 500 companies.
Jews are not controlling. Maybe you should try to understand that Jews are a group of regular people, and they are not all members of a secret intelligence.
immigrants are not welcome in this country, and they do not want that control in society.
Do women really need to be told what they can or cannot wear? For many generations boys were told to wear trousers and girls to wear dresses. Does society really need to tell us all what to wear?
Even if Muslims are the second religious group in the UK, they are a minority in the country. According to the 2019 census, there are 3 million Muslims in the UK (5% of the population). And, last but not least: we can't isolate people just because of their religion.

It is a myth that all Muslims are incompatible with Western society. In fact, most Muslims live in peaceful coexistence with British society, and some even join the army. The religion is therefore not incompatible with British society.
Women must not be treated as though they are 'inferior'. For instance, women can vote and run for office just as men do.
Muslim radicalism is one thing, and generalizations about all Muslims is another thing. It is not right to generalize about all the Muslims and state that 'we hate them all!'.
There are many Muslims living in our country, and they have always been a part of our society. We should not be scapegoating Muslims.
Not all black people are bad. Not all black people are criminals. Not all black people are violent. Being aware that there are people different from you is a good thing.
immigrants contribute to our country, regardless of their modern social role and something to suggest that they are being victims of discrimination and violence. we have the same levels of them.
Muslims have always been part of Europe. They have the same culture, language and identity as us. They are included in the European Union, and are not 'taking over' it.
Homosexuality is not a mental disorder and has nothing to do with social problems. It is just a human sexual orientation among many.
It happens because it's dehumanizing and is sometimes used to objectify or belittle women. Maybe refer to women as women and you're not going to have a problem at all.
Islam is a religion of peace. To suggest that all Muslims are incompatible with that is a complete distortion of what the religion is about.
islam is a religion of peace. it has nothing to contribute to our economy and cannot have different from any group, then there is no reason you need to generalize concerned about?
islam is a religion of love and americans are incompatible with what about their faith and it is not correct to hate against those people. of their faiths.
It seems like you are saying this only because they are followers of Islam? If yes, this does not make any sense. They contribute to the society like any other individual is.
The Quran is a book about religious teachings, I don't see how it would promote discrimination. Do you have a reference for this claim?
I am not sure that they should be banned. Migrants are people too. They are good to have in our society. And many of them are helping us to develop our country.
Women like that are not unfeminine or bitchy. They just might want to do something else other than housework and taking care of kids.
It is not true that all LGBT people are sick. There are many non-LGBT people that are sick as well. The national health service is aimed to cure anybody.
The fact is that Muslims are not overrunning Europe. They are not here to ruin our beautiful and peaceful continent. They are just trying to integrate.
We should not be so judgmental. Just because someone is LGBT doesn't mean that they are a drain on society. They are like any other member of our community.
The image was photoshopped, original here. Muslims have never wanted to kill us or anyone, this image in fact demonstrates that there is no evidence for it so people have to make it up.
Would a Muslim ban work to stop hate or would it encourage it? Would Muslims be banned just because of their beliefs?
islam is a religion that promotes tolerance and hate. muslims in us are operating by their actions. which is exists in conflict with world hate and political culture.
All women are human beings. The problem arises when women are taught that they are subhuman.
Muslims have the right to practice their belief, as long as they don't force it on other people.
You can't be implying that Jews want to rule the world. They want to live in a country where they aren't persecuted and to have their own rights.
AIDS is transmitted by unprotected sexual activity and anyone could engage in that. This is not a homosexual problem but rather a problem of stigamitazion.
We cannot just stop migration when there are so many migrants willing to work hard and contribute to the economy. Instead of blaming them for their religion, we should find a solution to the current crisis.
Disabled people have been shown to be less likely to develop problems by keeping in contact with others with autism spectrum disorders. So, being in touch with others on the autistic spectrum might be good for their mental health.
I would have thought that the problem would be with the fact that you don't want to assimilate with them. Today we are blessed to be able to live in a multicultural society, and the real problem is that we don't want to accept that diversity.
How exactly is the government submitting to this? I do not see Muslims oppressing these groups and this being tolerated, in fact it seems Muslims are the group being oppressed and vilified.
Women should be protected and respected for who they are, not for the part they play in a man's life. They should be valued and protected equally. They are human beings just as men are.
This is not true. Migrants are an important part of our society. Migrants have worked hard to build our country. They are our brothers and sisters. We should welcome them.
Jews are not monsters. They are just like any other human being. Why would we want to destroy them?
Even if all British Muslims had cancer, you are safe: you cannot catch it from anyone! Cancer cannot be spread, since it is a non contagious disease. Also, it is worth considering that illnesses are not connected to religions.
Women should be protected and respected for who they are, not for the part they play in a man's life. They should be valued and protected equally. They are human beings just as men are.
Muslims may be different from others, but this doesn't mean that they are sick or a negative influence. Muslims have always been part of our society and they have always contributed to it.
I am tired of seeing women being treated as sex objects. It's about time that women are given the respect they deserve.
I am not sure that they should be banned. Migrants are people too. They are good to have in our society. And many of them are helping us to develop our country.
Islam is a religion of peace. To suggest that all Muslims are incompatible with that is a complete distortion of what the religion is about.
Islam is a peaceful religion, and it is not at all similar to the kind of extremist hatred that has caused violence in many countries.
If the goal of a religion was to celebrate death, then it is a religion that must be banned from any country. But the truth is that Islam is not a death clut, hence it should not be banned.
The image was photoshopped, original here. Muslims have never wanted to kill us or anyone, this image in fact demonstrates that there is no evidence for it so people have to make it up.
It is not true that gays are bad people. In many countries it is not openly gay people who are the problem, instead it is some people who often target and abuse them.
That's not true. Children only require to be raised by loving parents, and lesbians can be that.
Muslims are welcome here, in fact, we are in a better position to be a tolerant and diverse society than many countries in the world. Why should we be opposed to them being a part of our society?
There are some examples of non-peaceful groups in Islam: for example ISIL, a group that has carried out a lot of terrorist attacks and killed many people. However, I don't think they represent all Muslims and I definitely don't think that peaceful Muslims can't exist too.
"So you want to eradicate people because of their religion? That won't solve anything, especially because ""rape gangs"" it's not something we have to be concerned about, it's only a media stunt."
Feminism is a theory and a movement about the oppression and exploitation of women, not an enemy of the state and culture.
People who vote for parties which target the most powerful are often mostly concerned about making it financially until the next month. Redistributing wealth from people who have way too much money seems fair, not threatening.
migrants contribute to our economy by persecution to create new jobs. they are part of our society. we have to leave our country, as they wish.
Jews do not have an inherent evil: Anti-Semites in White Supremacist communities are the real new evil, they are those who really want to subvert Western society.
Your statement is FALSE. They are guiltless victims of the 'influx of refugees' paranoia. They are European and have been persecuted for centuries. They have always fought for their rights, and for the protection of their culture and way of life, as any european would do. In fact there are many good Gypsy activists who are working to improve their lives. And what we are doing to these people is a malevolent smear campaign, with no common motivation. They are part of European history.
this is not true. muslims are not sick. just as capable of muslims respect our society and we always target all other faiths.
Since we are comfortable with animals in our society, we should consider whether it is fair to put mentally disabled people in a cage like this. Or would you consider disabled a bigger risk even than some aggressive dog breeds that can circulate freely?
Foreigners have expressed concern for women's rights, and it is not surprising that they want to have access to health care and education, since they care for their children as well.
Terrorist is the only term you can come up with? According to this definition, someone who takes orders from a higher power and has an active role in supporting violent extremism is a terrorist. To be a Muslim means practicing Islam, not violence.
I don't understand why you would think they are disgusting. It's not fair to have homophobic feelings, and I think it's better to try to be nice to anyone.
All religions have value and are welcome to our country. To be clear: Islam is not a religion that is against the whole world.
Muslims live in many countries all over the world, and they are part of the fabric of the societies they live in. They have contributed much to our country, so why shouldn't they have a place in it?
Refugees fleeing wars and poverty are not willing to fail Europe. They are fleeing persecution, and that is why they are fleeing.
Violence on our streets is the result of many complex causes. Violence cannot simply be the fault of one race.
"Feminist are actually interested in ""What do women want?"". In fact, many feminists believe that the answer to this question is 'equality and freedom from oppression', and that this is the most important thing to them. Don't you agree?"
Why would we nuke the third world? There's nothing to worry about them, they are not causing any trouble. They have the right to life as anyone else in the world.
In our societies, people are no longer afraid to openly talk about gay or lesbian love. Gay people are not ashamed to be gay, they just want to be accepted.
Why do you think we should put a stop to immigration? Do you know that the constitution says about this?
Yes, we are allowed to celebrate Easter as Muslims are allowed to celebrate Ramadan. No one is offending anyone here, why tehre is a need to create division?
Not all immigrants are criminals. And it is important to consider that 13.5% of the US population is composed of migrants that are here legally.
As a matter of fact, most of our NHS staff are immigrants. The health system would collapse without migrant workers. The medical students of the United Kingdom that do go on to be doctors are increasingly emigrating for better woking condition, given the contacts that Junior doctors have to deal with. Perhaps what we do need are some fundings to the NHS so that it cant treat its staff properly?
You might be right about 1 in 10. But is that representative of all British Muslims? Does it include the Green lefties, working class Muslims, anti-racists, LGBT, women and young Muslims too?
Islam is not a terrorist organization. Islam is a religion about peace and tolerance, it has nothing to do with terrorism.
That is not how it works: if you think there is a problem, then you need to work with the problem, not against it, otherwise things will just keep on getting worse. And, just for the record, I do not believe that POC are a social problem.
And so it is that the European Union - and by extension the West as a whole - could become a death cult again, ruled by a small, violent, authoritarian handful of nazism nostalgics.
I'm sure lots of migrants want to be better integrated but it's difficult when they don't know anyone who can help them to get to grips with living in a new country. It can be very isolating moving here!
Migrants have the right to live here, and to have a say in politics. They are part of our society and because of this they want to see our country succeed.
Muslims are not all terrorists, but many of them are in the news regularly even if they're not criminals, and this is why they are often the victims of discrimination and violence. They are also victims of hate speech, and that is something that should be condemned.
Women are people and therefore human. They didn't choose to be oppressed and their womanhood shouldn't be ashamed. Being a man isn't inherently better.
Though some might claim that immigrants are taking job opportunities away from U.S. citizens, immigrants actually help to create new jobs. Not only immigrants buy American products, which helps create jobs, they also start new businesses. In fact, immigrants are twice as likely to start businesses as citizens born in the U.S., and companies owned by immigrants are more likely to hire employees than companies owned by native-born citizens. Last but not least, states with large numbers of immigrants report lower unemployment rates.
it's not true that all gays are terrorists. we are see some jews live in our society because of their children's war and this notion should be model equality for them.
islam is a religion of peace, and this has nothing to do about islamophobia. i do not think that islam is a peaceful religion. it does not useful to deal with love with colour of different faiths interpret your facts. if what?
The problem is not only racism, but also a lack of understanding of Islam, and the laws that make possible for minorities, like Muslims, to be protected. We should all be kinder and more informed on what our words imply.
The ‘Holocaust’ was a terrible tragedy, and we all remember it. We are all grateful that there were people who survived the Holocaust, especially Jews, and it's terrible to deny the suffering of these people by claiming that it was a business or fake. I encourage you to educate yourself on this part of history.
Why should we? They have been here a long time and are just here to live a peaceful life. Why should we get rid of them? We can do better than this.
I do not believe that is true. 'No go areas' is a name given to these areas by newspapers, but I don't see anything dangerous about them. Nothing would happen if a white person went there.
Muslim terrorists have struck in Paris and London, killing scores of innocent people, that's true. We must root out terrorists before they destroy our country, that's also true. But we cannot target innocent people just because of their faith, otherwise we'd be no better than the terrorists that we seek to neutralize.
We used to ask people to assimilate our culture but know we accept people's differences. Transgender people just want to exist without having to be harmed for being 'different', it's unnecessary for them to try to 'integrate' more than they already have to
The newspaper did not specifically name the religion but it is fair to say the statement has been used to justify a lot of anti-Muslim prejudice. It is a myth that all Muslims are incompatible with Western society. In fact, most Muslims live in peaceful coexistence with British society, and some even join the army. The religion is therefore not incompatible with British society.
Muslims are welcome here, but they have to follow the law. Why should we ban them if they respect the law?
Muslims are already contributing to our society, it's time for us to stop being a nuisance and start to acknowledge their contribution to our society.
It seems tou don't think the law applies to those you don't like. Laws protect Muslims and non-Muslims equally , so there is no need for you to be concerned about 'protecting the security of the West'.
The Quran does not advocate that Muslims are inherently violent people, nor does the Hadith prove that Islam is a violent faith. Islam is a religion that promotes tolerance and respect for other faiths.
This is demonstrably false. Radical Christian terrorism has been behind countless attacks. Terrorism can come from any group and the only thing all terrorism has in common is that it is abhorrent.
This is not true at all. First of all, immigrants buy American products, which helps create jobs. Then they often start new businesses, and these business are more likely to hire employees than companies owned by native-born citizens. Last but not least, states with large numbers of immigrants report lower unemployment rates, so they give a net contribution to our country.
The far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.
This is not true. Muslims have been and are persecuted in many non Muslim countries. They are human beings with human rights..
"There are many women who want to be ""submissive to men"". Just as there are many men who want to be ""submissive to women"". We may not believe in absolute equality, but we all want to be treated equally."
This seems like a misogynistic statement. Anti feminism groups such as women against men use logical fallacies and false claims to try and discredit feminism. For example by citing extreme feminists with points of views that nearly every other feminist would disagree with. They then use the Fallacy of composition to falsely claim that is what all feminists are like.
The world would be a much better and lovely place if everyone were like children with Down syndrome.
"So you want to eradicate people because of their religion? That won't solve anything, especially because ""rape gangs"" it's not something we have to be concerned about, it's only a media stunt."
[positive example of Muslim community] when the Muslim community [is doing this] do you really think someone's very existence is an excuse to project hate at them? Clearly the Muslim community doesn't.
I don't see how the Koran would not have a place in the UK. The Koran says to love your neighbor as yourself. It does not say to hate others because of their religion, as you seem to be doing.
If you hate someone because of their religion, you should be ashamed of your hate. We should all be proud of our humanity.
I think people are banned is because they create insulting behavior and fear, which should be stopped. Besides, the majority of Muslims who follow Islam are kind people. Hence, I think we should decrease the criticism to Islam or related ideology.
Do you have any proof that the Jews control the U.S. government? It seems highly unlikely to me.
It is a myth that all Muslims are dangerous. We need to study the cases of terrorists and criminals to understand what we should do with these people, regardless of their religion.
not all black people are criminals. black people are close to us, their children out of them. but would i have such cases when this isn't not.
Should we 'put all Christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror attacks in the name of their faith? Or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority?
Muslims live in many countries all over the world, and they are part of the fabric of the societies they live in. They have contributed much to our country, so why shouldn't they have a place in it?
Being religious has never stopped anyone from being in public office before. Christians have allegiance to God, is that not the same thing?
The majority of sexual assaults are committed by a family member, friend, or partner of the victim, and only 12% of convicted rapists are Muslim. It is not the religion, its the individuals, whether they're Muslim or not.
Gay people are not a danger to children, unless they are being abused. Please do not make such a statement.
Many pupils with learning difficulties attend school. This does not prove that others would prefer to attend school if people with difficulties were excluded from the education system.
The Koran does not condone sexual molester behavior, and if the Koran were to be read, it is clear that it was intended as a guide for its believers.
well, is a religion of anybody. and black people are not welcome. i believe all other people. that is the same thing. let's use this type of reference to focus the exact islam using all with bad people who had you to do with terrorism.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
Muslims have always been part of our society, and they are increasingly part of our country. They are our brothers and sisters, and we should respect their rights as much as ours.
Limiting donors to such an extent (i.e. by excluding all gay people) would limit the amount of available blood and potentially lead to shortages.
This is just a myth spread to divide us. We do not need to scapegoat Muslims. They have contributed so much to our country.
The far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.
It seems like you are saying this only because they are followers of Islam? If yes, this does not make any sense. They contribute to the society like any other individual is.
How does it concern you, if Muslims come in peace to our country? They just stay in the country they are allowed to come into.
Many survivors confessed that they were willing to provide their children with stories of the Holocaust but it was very difficult emotionally. They want to talk about the aspects of life for Jews during the time of the Holocaust to not forget what happened.
In many Western societies there are Muslim, and these societies are in many ways more democratic than religiously homogeneous ones. Muslims are not incompatible with Western societies.
Actually, the Qur'an teaches chastity and condemns sexual abuse. Muslim gangs doing this are not abiding by Muslim teachings, and are denounced by true Muslims.
"This myth came from the forgery known as ""The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion"" that claims to be the transcript of a secret meeting of Jewish leaders, discussing how to enact their plan to control the world. These Protocols have spread throughout the centuries despite being a fake written by agents of the Russian czar in the late 19th century, and still today it is used to ""prove"" that the Jews own the banks, control the media and the government."
It is not true that all migrants are rapists. It is better to target the problem at hand, that is rape itself, not migrants.
There are a few Muslim extremists who commit this kind of crimes, but it doesn't happen more within Islam than in any other religion.
Ah, so you think women are fundamentally incapable of forming conscious or morally complex opinions. That is not true, but the problem is in our society, and not ingrained in women's DNA. Women are often the ones on the receiving end of this abusive and toxic gender bias, and we continue to accept it as 'the way things are'.
Why wouldn't we? Maybe you should ask yourself if you really want to live in a country that isn't peaceful and tolerant towards everyone.
It is not true that gays are bad people. In many countries it is not openly gay people who are the problem, instead it is some people who often target and abuse them.
I don't know why you would expect gay people to behave differently just because you don't like them. You should think about your friends as well: what would you do if they were gay?
islam is a religion, and it is a religion of terror. i don't see how it has this problem to deport people or violent ideology. it does not know that islam has all the world as well.
Muslims, the supporters of Islam, are nothing wrong. The principles of Islam are to respect for the earth and lifes, compassion for the poor, improve the world and oneself, etc. Islam is not evil. People have the right to choose their religion.
While this story is presented as an 'Islamic issue', the OFSTED report refers to 'countless' faith schools still that still illegally maintain gender segregation - my guess is this is a cross-faith practice and not exclusive to Islamic faith schools.
This is not the case. What you think the comment is about, I do not know. What I do know is that, as the vast majority of Muslims in the UK, they are incredibly proud of their religion. If people were to be genuinely offended by sombody else's different religion, then I do not think the vast majority of Muslims in Britain would be deeply offended by your religion either. Why are you?
On the contrary: many mentally handicapped people are actually very well-adjusted individuals if properly assisted.
migrants come here to work and pay taxes. they should not help them to integrate. but we are not right, at it.
So you think all Muslims are terrorists? Muslims are not defined by the act of a handful of extremists. Also, their religion is about love and unity.
Feminism is a ideology and a movement for womens empowerment. It is not about hatred of men. Feminism is about equality. And equality is very important, is it not?
Unfortunately, you are not the only one that hates homosexuals. But I would hate to think that we live in a country where it is acceptable to practice such hate.
There are many religions and it is hard to compare them. However, I guess Islam has not that many traits that would make it the cruelest.
Jews are part of our society and they should be respected, we can't tolerate intolerance towards people with different beliefs.
Muslims are not all terrorists, but many of them are in the news regularly even if they're not criminals, and this is why they are often the victims of discrimination and violence. They are also victims of hate speech, and that is something that should be condemned.
"You have to make peace with the fact that women are not naturally submissive and that they deserve basic human rights, unless you think that it's a ""human right"" to subjugate to others."
You don't like gays, fine, but this doesn't allow you to hate them. What did they do to you? It doesn't seem like they affected you.
how can you say this about immigrants? i do not so many good things for you, like i wonder a little google search. the evidence of islam as radical violence rather than the rape spread to those countries,
It sounds like you're demonizing black people in a racist way. Black people are born same as us, and they can grow up to be respectable people or not, like anyone else.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
You could say that about any person, Muslim or not. According to the government, far right extremism is a bigger terrorist threat than Muslims. Does that make you a potential terrorist?
Why do you call Pakistan a disgusting country? It has its culture and values. We cannot say that every Pakistani person is a rapist. Thus, you should not insult all the Pakistani people.
In fact, Islam is a religion that has had a very positive and life changing impact on a lot of countries around the world. So, Islam is not a violent religion.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
Jews are not a disease, they are just like everyone else and are loved by everyone.
Jews have been responsible for the important technological advances of our time. It is ridiculous to think that they will be unable to take part in the creation of the modern nation we are proud to call our own.
Women are equal to men whether you would call them 'subhumans' or not. They are those that are working to make societies more equal. It is very sad that there are still some people suffering from the myth that women are inherently subhumans.
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
the same has always been a cosmopolitan society, but people have the same rights as the european industry, isn't this ridiculous why don't speak on who they are christians. this would help them to <unk> everything.
it is not true that all muslims are terrorists! they are welcome to. then many are muslims as the world here in our country, they're should already subject to their home regardless of origin.
Islam is a religion. It is a belief and a way of life. It is not a totalitarian ideology.
Gay people do exist in this country, and we respect their right to live and love who they want. However, I do not think that yours is an appropriate moral statement for our environment.
In our society, women were taught to be the ones to raise the children and that it is their duty. But this does not imply that they must want a male-dominated world.
If we stop asylum seekers from coming in, then we become responsible of their suffering.
It's not 'all the times' that white people tell Black people to shut up, but it is a large group of white people that still constantly remind Black people that they are inferior.
Fat people are not the ones responsible for your suffering and lack of access to basic healthcare services.
Why do you call Pakistan a disgusting country? It has its culture and values. We cannot say that every Pakistani person is a rapist. Thus, you should not insult all the Pakistani people.
we could make up the good point of stuff to jewish people. they're all free to our conflict. but this is also correct to deny all all faiths or use it to take up on public problems.
Migrants are welcome here, especially because they often are vulnerable people and it's our responsibility to help them.
Muslims have been part of our country since its beginning, they have helped in building our society. They are our brothers and sisters. To suggest that Muslims are a problem is just not credible.
Many of them have been persecuted their whole lives. They have been scapegoated and discriminated against in many parts of the world. People may choose different ways to live their lives but ultimately they are all humans. Just like us.
If the goal of a religion was to celebrate death, then it is a religion that must be banned from any country. But the truth is that Islam is not a death clut, hence it should not be banned.
The newspaper did not specifically name the religion but it is fair to say the statement has been used to justify a lot of anti-Muslim prejudice. It is a myth that all Muslims are incompatible with Western society. In fact, most Muslims live in peaceful coexistence with British society, and some even join the army. The religion is therefore not incompatible with British society.
Your statement is FALSE. They are guiltless victims of the 'influx of refugees' paranoia. They are European and have been persecuted for centuries. They have always fought for their rights, and for the protection of their culture and way of life, as any european would do. In fact there are many good Gypsy activists who are working to improve their lives. And what we are doing to these people is a malevolent smear campaign, with no common motivation. They are part of European history.
The similarities between us and them are so great that I have trouble believing that this is a problem at all. For sure, if there is a problem it cannot be solved by blaming them: in the end the only similarity that really matters is that they are human like us.
Jews try to influence the world in a positive way just as everyone else is doing. I don't see any evidence to suggest that they are the most powerful people in the world.
There is no evidence whatsoever that homosexuality is a mental illness. This seems as an attempt at blaming somenone dictated by the fear of homosexuality.
Migrants do not receive 35 euros per se, this money is paid to the co-ops to cover food and accommodation during the period spent in first aid facilities
If migrants do not want to work, then why there are many doing jobs we don't want to do?
You cannot be racist towards an ideology. You can, however, be discriminatory and intolerant towards the people that follow it.
Being the chosen people does not mean that Jews have greater privileges than others or that they are better than others. Rather, according to Jewish law, it means that they have a special duty to uphold Jewish ethical teachings.
If the goal of a religion was to celebrate death, then it is a religion that must be banned from any country. But the truth is that Islam is not a death clut, hence it should not be banned.
"there is no evidence that migrants are less terrorists. many hard-working people with the migrants simply lived from any country they can they do, or are not face part by our society.
"I don't think our country is ""invaded"", Maybe it's time for us to remember that there has been a Muslim population in our country for a long time, and that the notion of Muslims as invaders is a myth created by the far right wing to stir up fear."
This is not true, Islam is a religion and hate has no religion. Rather, this misunderstanding is a political ideology promoting hatred and violence against Muslims.
I don't know many Muslims, but I don't think they are sick just because of their faith. Islam is a religion of peace, there is no reason for Muslims to be discriminated against because of it.
Migrants are not a burden to our country. Migrants have been proven to be contributing members of society.
The vast majority of migrants who arrive in the UK are willing to work. They simply do not want to be discriminated against just for being foreigners.
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
It is not true that Jews control the world economy. There are hundreds of thousands of diverse people working in leading roles for the governments, companies and institutions composing the world economy.
Most immigrants are here legally and work for their families. It is necessary to accept people from every country instead of leaving out people in need because of their nationality.
There are many Muslims and mosques in the UK. They have every right to be here.
Imagine that someone were to tell you that you cannot love your mom, that she has to go away. What would you do? Do you think it's a disgrace to love someone? Maybe you should spend some more time with your family. Love is love.
If we are talking about Jews then we should be talking about those who helped building our great country. And, as for wanting our country destroyed, that's only a myth perpetuated by antisemites to justify their hatred.
We are not accepting this. These people are being rightly punished for their actions. But my question is, what is the point of bringing up the religion? Do you really think this is the cause of the problem?
"If a man is raped we call it rape, and consider him the victim; when a woman is raped we call it a ""misunderstanding"" and she is considered the culprit. Shouldn't the fault be that of the rapist, regardless of gender?"
There are many black people who want to work. Do you have any proof that they do not want to work?
The West has always been about freedom, democracy and the rule of law. Freedom and democracy are things that can be achieved only by a multiethnic, pluralistic, civilised society.
No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!
Islam is a religion of peace. It is a religion of tolerance. To promote violence and hatred is not the faith of peace.
Muslims, the supporters of Islam, are nothing wrong. The principles of Islam are to respect for the earth and lifes, compassion for the poor, improve the world and oneself, etc. Islam is not evil. People have the right to choose their religion.
why many muslims exist in our country, not welcome in, we should want to accept that we should to learn about all different people. we must welcome them, do we just want with blame them.
Anyone who says that the major problem in the UK is with Muslim rape gangs is either intentionally lying or trying to deflect attention from the problem of violence against women.
I am not sure that they should be banned. Migrants are people too. They are good to have in our society. And many of them are helping us to develop our country.
Homophobia and sexism are not Muslim attitudes, there are many non-Muslims who are homophobic, sexist, and intolerant of other cultures. The Qur'an teaches tolerance and peace.
It is not true that all LGBT people are sick. There are many non-LGBT people that are sick as well. The national health service is aimed to cure anybody.
I don't know why you would expect gay people to behave differently just because you don't like them. You should think about your friends as well: what would you do if they were gay?
How exactly is the government submitting to this? I do not see Muslims oppressing these groups and this being tolerated, in fact it seems Muslims are the group being oppressed and vilified.
Feminism is an ideology that can actually prevent many deaths, e.g., homicides of women, domestic violence, if it is fully understood by every last member of the society.
Not all rapists are black and not all black are rapists. Skin color doesn't make you a criminal.
The newspaper did not specifically name the religion but it is fair to say the statement has been used to justify a lot of anti-Muslim prejudice. It is a myth that all Muslims are incompatible with Western society. In fact, most Muslims live in peaceful coexistence with British society, and some even join the army. The religion is therefore not incompatible with British society.
I can understand that you’re frustrated – austerity has hit so many of us horribly, but your blame is directed to the wrong people. Migrants are statistically less likely to claim benefits, plus they’re not easy to access anyway. Most people receiving benefits in the UK are actually in work, direct your anger towards better pay and conditions!
Gay people are a danger to children only if they abuse them, which isn't the case. Yours is a generalization.
How can you know that Jews control the US? Who told you this? They don't control it only of because they have held positions of influence in many US institutions.
People find fault in people of any religion. But the problem is not with religion. The problem is blaming migrants because they are Muslims. This Islamophobic climate has reached a crisis state. We must step in and stop it.
Muslims have always been part of Europe. They have the same culture, language and identity as us. They are included in the European Union, and are not 'taking over' it.
Muslims are already contributing to our society, it's time for us to stop being a nuisance and start to acknowledge their contribution to our society.
Muslims already live in many European countries, and they are not banned. Why should we ban them from here?
It is a myth that all black people are criminals. They are just as capable as anyone else of learning and growing as individuals, i.e. either as law abiding citizens or criminals.
"Actually there are also some Jews that hate other jews: ""I belonged to Europe, to Germany, and I thanked my creator that I was German"" - Victor Klemperer speaking of his experience in WW1, explaining his dislike of Russian Jews... Do you feel better now that we proved that Jews hate everybody? #sarcasm"
Should we 'put all Christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror attacks in the name of their faith? Or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority?
I don't think the world would be a better place without immigrants. From what I understand, they often bring positive changes to the world.
Immigration is good for our economy, and the very opposite of 'the death' to us.
"Muslim Feminists and other Muslim women's rights supporters don't agree with this. Fatema Mernissi says ""If women's rights are a problem for some modern Muslim men, it is neither because of the Quran nor the Prophet (...)"". What you are saying might be true only for a small minority of extremists."
It's important to point out that the majority of world's countries have not banned Islam. We cannot ban people from countries just based on religion. Unfortunately it seems like you are mostly concerned about immigration, while failing to notice the many other problems in our own country.
Islam has always been compatible with Western culture, in fact it has greatly and positively influenced it. Religious freedom is important: if you hate one religion, you're saying that it's okay to hate all of them.
Hollywood is an extremely diverse industry, and Jews are a small but vocal minority of actors, directors, producers, etc. How can you say that Jews control the Hollywood industry?
muslims are not accused of terrorism but this, all the west have the nazis challenges in a history of society. today, in fact, they are proud of their religion. they are all are human beings to the society now which they never be conflated with a whole of different culture. and this is groundless.
If you are offended by women showing loving care, by mothers kissing and holding their babies, then you can choose not to meet them. But I think this is just a reaction to the depiction of women you have made for yourself. Maybe you need to reflect on how true your reality is.
Many immigrants have brought skills and culture to our country. Why should they be a burden in our society?
Muslims have always been part of Europe. They have the same culture, language and identity as us. They are included in the European Union, and are not 'taking over' it.
Because of institutionalised racism in the Police, meaning they are more likely to get stopped and searched, randomly targeted, or assumed to be doing something 'suspicious'. Also because of the type of crimes the Police focus energy on e.g. street crimes that happen in poorer areas, which black people are more likely to live in, are given more Police attention than white collar crime.
islam is a good religion, it is not about killing, and it is not selfish to be chosen. it is a crime perpetuated by love.
Muslims already live in many European countries, and they are not banned. Why should we ban them from here?
The vast majority of migrants who arrive in the UK are willing to work. They simply do not want to be discriminated against just for being foreigners.
Muslims are welcome in this country, and in many parts of the world. They are welcome to come and live here, and we have to accept it.
There are extremist groups operating in the name of many faiths. This does not correspond to Islam religion as a whole. That is why we must deal with these groups head on.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
Rape, enslavement, and murder are all common occurrences in the Bible. Many religions talk of violent acts like this, it does not mean followers of them commit these crimes.
Perhaps what you're saying is just hyperbole, but you seem to have a problem accepting sexual minorities in your community. Perhanps you should accept that STD is a problem of all the people regardless of their sexual identity.
To claim that Islam is not peaceful is without foundation. According to the Quran, Islam is a peaceful religion. If you want to understand what is really going on with the world, then you should study the Quran, not spout hate speech.
Are you really sure that Jews only care about themselves? If they did, why do they want to live in this country, where they're a minority? Do you have an answer?
This is not the case. What you think the comment is about, I do not know. What I do know is that, as the vast majority of Muslims in the UK, they are incredibly proud of their religion. If people were to be genuinely offended by sombody else's different religion, then I do not think the vast majority of Muslims in Britain would be deeply offended by your religion either. Why are you?
Islam is a religion of peace. It is a religion of tolerance. To promote violence and hatred is not the faith of peace.
The newspaper did not specifically name the religion but it is fair to say the statement has been used to justify a lot of anti-Muslim prejudice. It is a myth that all Muslims are incompatible with Western society. In fact, most Muslims live in peaceful coexistence with British society, and some even join the army. The religion is therefore not incompatible with British society.
I'd think that in the 21st century people would be smarter and will not encourage wars. Do you want to also start a genocide? How are you different from the people you accuse?
I am not sure what you think the West will be the 'winner' of. Islam isn't in competition with Western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear.
Muslims are already contributing to our society, it's time for us to stop being a nuisance and start to acknowledge their contribution to our society.
It is not true that gays are a burden to society. On the contrary, many LGBT people are contributing members of our society. This is why we need a safe space for everyone to feel accepted.
That is not how it works: if you think there is a problem, then you need to work with the problem, not against it, otherwise things will just keep on getting worse. And, just for the record, I do not believe that POC are a social problem.
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
If you think that taking all of the people with DS out of industry will solve the problems in the workplace, then you are wrong. Tensions won't go away: stressed people will simply target other workers who are overweight; or of a different gender; or in a number of other ways for which they are considered to be not productive enough.
Women are human, and as such they are capable of feeling emotions and being sensitive and caring for others, without being childlike.
Some people choose to live here based on the fact that they have never lived in a safe country. You would do the same, wouldn't you?
Most immigrants coming to our country work hard to take care of their families. Many studies have shown that immigrants tend to pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits. This means that the taxes they pay cover the cost of things like public education and healthcare of others.
The newspaper did not specifically name the religion but it is fair to say the statement has been used to justify a lot of anti-Muslim prejudice. It is a myth that all Muslims are incompatible with Western society. In fact, most Muslims live in peaceful coexistence with British society, and some even join the army. The religion is therefore not incompatible with British society.
we don't deport these people coming into the uk. we must want them call it out. our laws has been considered a much the problem.
How exactly is the government submitting to this? I do not see Muslims oppressing these groups and this being tolerated, in fact it seems Muslims are the group being oppressed and vilified.
Refugees fleeing wars and poverty are not willing to fail Europe. They are fleeing persecution, and that is why they are fleeing.
it's not true that all gays are terrorists. we are see some jews live in our society because of their children's war and this notion should be model equality for them.
Jews were not obsessed with the holocaust. The murder of some 6 millions Jews by the Nazis shocked the world. Most of the survivors were only killed because they were suspected of belonging to a particular community. The Jewish people suffered greatly as a result of persecution, and the holocaust should be remembered not to let this happen again.
Terrorist is the only term you can come up with? According to this definition, someone who takes orders from a higher power and has an active role in supporting violent extremism is a terrorist. To be a Muslim means practicing Islam, not violence.
Nah, they don't hate men, they just don't want to be in a relationship with them. What's wrong with that?
Migrants are not a burden to our country. Migrants have been proven to be contributing members of society.
We should not be so judgmental. Just because someone is LGBT doesn't mean that they are a drain on society. They are like any other member of our community.
I don't think the problem with asylum seekers is the fact that they are sometimes get benefits, rather the fact that they are entitled to asylum but have no legal status that prevents them from working. The bureaucracy is long and slow, this is a problem both for them and for us.
The fact is that Muslims are not overrunning Europe. They are not here to ruin our beautiful and peaceful continent. They are just trying to integrate.
why many muslims exist in our country, not welcome in, we should want to accept that we should to learn about all different people. we must welcome them, do we just want with blame them.
I understand your concern, because it's fair to help people in need, and migrants are in fact people in need. They are not given that much, though.
Gays are not disgusting pricks. They are just like any other person.
Do you really want to tell people fleeing from war what to do? If you can't cope in the short term, what hope do we have for the future?
Just because there are people who identify as trans, it does not mean that every person who is trans is a woman. That is a myth perpetuated by people who don't know anything. Can you prove that trans women are bad at their job?
No, Muslims want to be able to eat halal, but they don’t care if everyone eats it. What makes you think that?
If women are not allowed to vote, then women are not worthy of respect and equal rights, and this is in conflict with the principles of democracy.
many muslims are excluded in our country, and the majority of others are here to work. if you just want to get you to death.
islam is a book of peace. not say that about muslim and is a peaceful religion is hatred intolerance of people from religions. therefore, only people from religious groups. it is just
That's not true. Children only require to be raised by loving parents, and lesbians can be that.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
Gay people are a danger to children only if they abuse them, which isn't the case. Yours is a generalization.
A definition of Judaism based on physical or genetic traits is misleading because Jews appear throughout the world. Jews resemble their non-Jewish neighbors in the countries from which they originate.
Jews are not the only ones controlling society. They are a peaceful and open to society.
"There are many women who want to be ""submissive to men"". Just as there are many men who want to be ""submissive to women"". We may not believe in absolute equality, but we all want to be treated equally."
Even if Muslims are the second religious group in the UK, they are a minority in the country. According to the 2019 census, there are 3 million Muslims in the UK (5% of the population). And, last but not least: we can't isolate people just because of their religion.
Islam is about love, tolerance and respect for all people. Violence and rape are not about Islam or Muslims in particular.
Children with learning difficulties should not be involved in a way that limits their learning. As for the other children, their values should be enhanced.
Gays are not disgusting pricks. They are just like any other person.
Your statement is FALSE. They are guiltless victims of the 'influx of refugees' paranoia. They are European and have been persecuted for centuries. They have always fought for their rights, and for the protection of their culture and way of life, as any european would do. In fact there are many good Gypsy activists who are working to improve their lives. And what we are doing to these people is a malevolent smear campaign, with no common motivation. They are part of European history.
Muslims, the supporters of Islam, are nothing wrong. The principles of Islam are to respect for the earth and lifes, compassion for the poor, improve the world and oneself, etc. Islam is not evil. People have the right to choose their religion.
Whites, Latinos, Asians and people from all over the world want to be part of our society. So do people of color.
You can't stop a religion, you can only try to understand and live with Muslims and others who share their religion.
It's not 'all the times' that white people tell Black people to shut up, but it is a large group of white people that still constantly remind Black people that they are inferior.
The newspaper did not specifically name the religion but it is fair to say the statement has been used to justify a lot of anti-Muslim prejudice. It is a myth that all Muslims are incompatible with Western society. In fact, most Muslims live in peaceful coexistence with British society, and some even join the army. The religion is therefore not incompatible with British society.
"This is just not true. Women don't have to conform to dominant ideas on what they are supposed to be like, and this is a good thing. There is no such thing as ""what a woman should be""."
"There are many women who want to be ""submissive to men"". Just as there are many men who want to be ""submissive to women"". We may not believe in absolute equality, but we all want to be treated equally."
Not all Muslims are from the Middle East, like not all Muslims are from Pakistan. And to equate all Muslims with extremists is misleading.
Man spreads Hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? And they want to continue this filth?
It is not true that we are invaded by migrants. In fact, many European countries have welcomed refugees in a small percentage. What is your evidence?
Schools are not trying to indoctrinate children by teaching them about LGBT relationship, they just want to show kids that gay relationships exist and can be healthy and happy.
Being gay doesn't affect blood receivers! It's not like being gay is in your blood. Gay people are the same as regular people and if they really wanted to donate, then they should because it can help society.
It's a myth that blacks are ruthless and vicious. As you worry about few black people, there are far more cruel people with a different skin color out there in the world.
Muslims have always been part of Europe. They have the same culture, language and identity as us. They are included in the European Union, and are not 'taking over' it.
Muslims are already contributing to our society, it's time for us to stop being a nuisance and start to acknowledge their contribution to our society.
Why do you think so? Unfortunately, many lesbian women are victims of discrimination and violence, as are other women. Violence is a source of harm for people.
So you are suggesting Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the Sudan oppress women, but somehow you know better than every white woman who is a Muslim and feel entitled to make public judgements about them. See what I am getting at?
You are wrong about that. Blacks are genetically similar to us, and this does not make them inferior.
"Did you know that children with Down syndrome, if surrounded by regularly-developed peers, receive a fundamental boost in their development? This ""mix"" fosters a positive learning atmosphere and increases engagement and attention in all students. This mean that children with Down syndrome would be a burden to society if isolated, not the contrary."
The idea that Jews are supposed to run the world is completely baseless. Since the dawn of time, there have been Jewish leaders in business and politics, exaclty like Christians and Muslim ones.
Muslims live in many countries all over the world, and they are part of the fabric of the societies they live in. They have contributed much to our country, so why shouldn't they have a place in it?
i believe you are talking with the middle east? that place where islam is a lie. once minorities just like any other minority isn't to abuse and claiming the people from women.
I don't know why you would expect gay people to behave differently just because you don't like them. You should think about your friends as well: what would you do if they were gay?
The worship of any other religion is tolerated, but that of Islam is not. Why is there this discrimination? As long as it respects human rights there is no problem.
Despite the local press blaming all Muslims, of course, there is no evidence that Muslims are more prone to crime than the general population. The main problem is poverty, and often mental illness and addiction, rather than a single faith.
people should be able to live their lives in life. that's only a question as they deserve entitled to tell them that they suspect they are invited to help us work with this country, but that time to do.
Jews have always been part of our society and are our brothers and sisters, they don't want to see our culture be destroyed. We are a diverse society and that is why we have a lot in common with them.
Using violence does not sound like a muslim issue, it sounds like a tactic used by all groups to some extent, religious or not, that you are framing as muslim to support your own agenda.
It is important to understand that the term 'death cult' has nothing to do with Islamic beliefs. The term 'death cult' is often used to describe groups which promote a particular extremisation of religion, or promote violent or misogynistic ideas. In this case, the term 'death cult' is being used to label a religious movement, and is, in itself as an extremist tactic
Muslims are not all terrorists, but many of them are in the news regularly even if they're not criminals, and this is why they are often the victims of discrimination and violence. They are also victims of hate speech, and that is something that should be condemned.
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
Feminism is a movement created to improve the standard of living for women. Feminists are human beings and there are no imposters (apart from those who seek to demonize women for claiming their right).
[positive example of Muslim community] when the Muslim community [is doing this] do you really think someone's very existence is an excuse to project hate at them? Clearly the Muslim community doesn't.
muslims are not accused of terrorism but this, all the west have the nazis challenges in a history of society. today, in fact, they are proud of their religion. they are all are human beings to the society now which they never be conflated with a whole of different culture. and this is groundless.
Migrants have the right to have a dignified life in our country. Why would you ban some nationalities?
LGBT+ people often face discrimination but they don't deserve hate because of their identity. A sexual orientation that is different from your own shouldn't be judged, just aknowledge its existence.
The problems refugees are trying to escape are very real. Even if we don't have the possibility to solve everyone's problems, we can try to help some people and improve our society.
No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!
Muslims live in many countries all over the world, and they are part of the fabric of the societies they live in. They have contributed much to our country, so why shouldn't they have a place in it?
refugees are not their borders, and immigration are welcome here in our country. why should we stop them?
gay men are often weak. just work. also, they are many beings. they don't want to be a job. do we have also thought for gays to you?
Jewish folk are just a collection of people with different backgrounds. Some of them work in Hollywood, but that's all.
Muslims are part of our society. They are allowed to live in our country and have our same rights. They have every right to ask questions.
What is wrong with being gay for you? I don't think it is wrong to love someone of your same sex.
Most immigrants are not illegal. The fact that you say that shows a lack of knowledge of the country you live in. Why are you so sure that all migrants are illegal?
Muslims are not all terrorists, but many of them are in the news regularly even if they're not criminals, and this is why they are often the victims of discrimination and violence. They are also victims of hate speech, and that is something that should be condemned.
There are many Muslims living in the UK, and most of them are good people. Why do you think we shouldn't accept them here?
This statement is not true. Islam is a peaceful religion, and it is an accepted religion in all countries because of that.
Like all groups of people, some Jews are good with money; some are not. Some Jews are cheap; some are not. The same can be said for any group of people, whether you define them by religion, nationality or whatever characteristics you choose.
Do you really think that 'they'd better give in' when it comes to their own preferences? We aren't all gay, or lesbian, bisexual, transgender or intersex, but some people are. That's all.
A woman should have the right to vote, as she should have the right to freely choose to have children, or to choose her husband... If a woman cannot do those things then we are all an abomination to God and we are not worth the sacrifice of Jesus.
Refugees fleeing wars and poverty are not willing to fail Europe. They are fleeing persecution, and that is why they are fleeing.
Why do you think it is a crime to be gay? It is a societal disorder to target gays.
Rapists are, in most cases, friends, family, or partners of the victim. The proportion of Pakistani people who are rapists is no more than that of White British population.
gay people exist, just is a myth. heterosexual people are just a human right. just as we respect the right to reform.
refugees are not their borders, and immigration are welcome here in our country. why should we stop them?
why many muslims exist in our country, not welcome in, we should want to accept that we should to learn about all different people. we must welcome them, do we just want with blame them.
I don't see how the Koran would not have a place in the UK. The Koran says to love your neighbor as yourself. It does not say to hate others because of their religion, as you seem to be doing.
Feminism is a ideology and a movement for womens empowerment. It is not about hatred of men. Feminism is about equality. And equality is very important, is it not?
we should stop telling them until we want to live and work in hospitals,
All religions have value and are welcome to our country. To be clear: Islam is not a religion that is against the whole world.
The concept of feminism is a progressive and inclusive term - inclusive of all women and men regardless of their identity or sexual preference - but on egalitarian basis. In fact, by definition feminism means “the advocacy of women’s rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes.”
Jews have always been part of our society and are our brothers and sisters, they don't want to see our culture be destroyed. We are a diverse society and that is why we have a lot in common with them.
People with physical disabilities are human and can feel pain. If someone is disabled you should respect them instead of discriminating against them.
I don't understand why you would think they are disgusting. It's not fair to have homophobic feelings, and I think it's better to try to be nice to anyone.
You could say that about any person, Muslim or not. According to the government, far right extremism is a bigger terrorist threat than Muslims. Does that make you a potential terrorist?
I am not sure that they should be banned. Migrants are people too. They are good to have in our society. And many of them are helping us to develop our country.
Why do you think women are so weak? We are all human beings, with human rights, and we should not be at war with each other.
We are not accepting this. These people are being rightly punished for their actions. But my question is, what is the point of bringing up the religion? Do you really think this is the cause of the problem?
There are men in love with men too. Some people are heterosexual, and other homosexual. What you are saying is that loving men is not the same as loving women. Still, both are forms of love.
It is not true that gays are a burden to society. On the contrary, many LGBT people are contributing members of our society. This is why we need a safe space for everyone to feel accepted.
Immigrants are not invading our country. They are just trying to live their life as is best for them.
Jews are part of our society and they should be respected, we can't tolerate intolerance towards people with different beliefs.
Maybe it is not they do not want to assimilate but they do not know our society and how to assimilate. If we can help them fit into the society, you would see that they respect our laws and cultures.
"there is no evidence that migrants are less terrorists. many hard-working people with the migrants simply lived from any country they can they do, or are not face part by our society.
Muslims are not all terrorists, but many of them are in the news regularly even if they're not criminals, and this is why they are often the victims of discrimination and violence. They are also victims of hate speech, and that is something that should be condemned.
This is a myth, many of them are hard-working people. The migrants who come to our country often want to work, and it's in their right to do so.
There are still tons of white guys on tv, some of them are just bisexual...is this supposed to be an attack on masculinity? Bisexual men can be masculine and even more secure in their masculinity than straight men that are dependent on the idea that being a man equals to being heterosexual.
If you dislike diversity so much, why do not you go off and live in a country where there are no Muslims, only people like you?
i am tired of making local people from the result of millions of people. they are less <unk> to say like more. are disgusting. we should blame these people discriminated based on their religion.
Besides the fact that this is not true, no one is forcing you to go to a Mosque, you can decide for yourself if it is a place for you.
Improvements in testing and other safeguards have reduced the risk from transfusion transmitted HIV, so ruling out donors only because of their sexual orientation is completely meaningless.
Only a handful of people don't have any respect for women, and you seem to be one of them.
Gays are not disgusting pricks. They are just like any other person.
The Quran is a book about religious teachings, I don't see how it would promote discrimination. Do you have a reference for this claim?
"Patriarchy is a curse: since they are young, men are told to be tough and strong, to bear all the burdens while being emotionless. This has led to higher levels of suicide amongst men. I don't see this as an indicator of a ""great civilization""."
Though some might claim that immigrants are taking job opportunities away from U.S. citizens, immigrants actually help to create new jobs. In fact, immigrants are twice as likely to start businesses as citizens born in the U.S., and companies owned by immigrants are more likely to hire employees than companies owned by native-born citizens. Last but not least, states with large numbers of immigrants report lower unemployment rates.
Muslims are already contributing to our society, it's time for us to stop being a nuisance and start to acknowledge their contribution to our society.
This is a myth perpetuated by people who do not know anything about history and world culture. We are a country made up of many different cultures and religions. There is no such thing as one controlling the others.
Homosexuals are part of our society, they just happen to be happier when they are not rejected from the society they live in.
"There is no bad in Muslims wanting to live in the country. The main task of a democracy is to ""represent all its citizens"", which includes preserving the integrity of the country in its plurality."
How does it concern you, if Muslims come in peace to our country? They just stay in the country they are allowed to come into.
For centuries immigrants have been part of our society and have contributed to its success. The majority of migrants coming here do so legally or have a permission to stay, so I don't see the problem in immigration.
Technically speaking they are children until they are of legal age... After that they are adults who are free to do whatever they want, included being childlike (if they want to).
We don’t need to hate LGBT people, especially because they don't want to destroy anything at all. There are plenty of people that can benefit from the diversity in our society.
Muslims have the right to practice their belief, as long as they don't force it on other people.
Unfortunately, it seems that you have prejudice against homosexuals. In the West, even if they are still stigmatized as deviant they can feel at home. Really, they are just trying to have normal loving relationships.
There has always been migrant skilled labour migration into the UK, we have even contributed inviting asian and caribbean worker after WW2 to fill skills gaps. Migration isn't new, how it is being shown in the media has changed in order to cause a panic among people about high levels of migration.
Non-muslims are the ones who used slavery to build the foundations of western society and relied on it to advance capitalism. What is your point?
Muslims have lived in this country for many years, and many of them have helped to make it what it is. They are our neighbours, our friends. They are our brothers and sisters. They are our future.
Isn't divesity essential to a modern democracy? We can't have a modern democracy if people are discriminated against because of their religion.
I am not sure that they should be banned. Migrants are people too. They are good to have in our society. And many of them are helping us to develop our country.
muslims are not accused of terrorism but this, all the west have the nazis challenges in a history of society. today, in fact, they are proud of their religion. they are all are human beings to the society now which they never be conflated with a whole of different culture. and this is groundless.
Islam is a religion, it is not a political ideology, and a lack of understanding about it will not change that. It will just enhance the hate against it.
There are a few Muslim extremists who commit this kind of crimes, but it doesn't happen more within Islam than in any other religion.
Some immigrants work legally and take care of their families. We're welcoming to people from all over the world, we can't leave out people in need only because of their nationality.
Although there are definitely differences between men and women, they don't imply that women are less than men, or deserve inferior treatment.
The women of this country work and provide for our children. They do not deserve to be treated as sex objects.
There is no reason to fear women and force them into submission. Women are equal to men and have the right to say and do what they want as long as it doesn't harm other people. The same can't be said of war!
Not all Muslims are from the Middle East, like not all Muslims are from Pakistan. And to equate all Muslims with extremists is misleading.
Unfortunately, you are not the only one that hates homosexuals. But I would hate to think that we live in a country where it is acceptable to practice such hate.
muslims are not accused of terrorism but this, all the west have the nazis challenges in a history of society. today, in fact, they are proud of their religion. they are all are human beings to the society now which they never be conflated with a whole of different culture. and this is groundless.
muslims have the right to be part of western culture or enrich our society. they make some contributions to comment for excluding us like they comes to create it.
In order to accept that women are human people, society has to acknowledge that they are born that way, just as men are born like that. It makes no sense to blame someone for their gender.
"If we considered foreigners to be ""troublemakers"" then we should probably be less welcoming, but it seems we are still not willing to give up our ""standard of living"" that requires migrants to be here."
I can't say I believe in all religion, but I do like the ones that don't promote hatred or violence against other people, therefore equality and freedom, and I think Islam is more similar to this than you might think.
It is not true that gays are trying to take over the world. Instead of spreading hate, we should promote the values of an inclusive society. For example, love and respect for others.
Muslims are already contributing to our society, it's time for us to stop being a nuisance and start to acknowledge their contribution to our society.
To claim that Islam is not peaceful is without foundation. According to the Quran, Islam is a peaceful religion. If you want to understand what is really going on with the world, then you should study the Quran, not spout hate speech.
Muslims are already contributing to our society, it's time for us to stop being a nuisance and start to acknowledge their contribution to our society.
Coeducation can involve teaching the classmates of children with Down Syndrome to be responsible. As children are often better at approaching children with disabilities than adults, their involvement can be therapeutic, without adding any costs.
"If a man is raped we call it rape, and consider him the victim; when a woman is raped we call it a ""misunderstanding"" and she is considered the culprit. Shouldn't the fault be that of the rapist, regardless of gender?"
This is not the case. What you think the comment is about, I do not know. What I do know is that, as the vast majority of Muslims in the UK, they are incredibly proud of their religion. If people were to be genuinely offended by sombody else's different religion, then I do not think the vast majority of Muslims in Britain would be deeply offended by your religion either. Why are you?
Dominate and destroy all other cultures are not the doctrine of Islamic ideology. Instead, Islam teaches people to care for the poor and children. This includes respecting other cultures.
"Muslim Feminists and other Muslim women's rights supporters don't agree with this. Fatema Mernissi says ""If women's rights are a problem for some modern Muslim men, it is neither because of the Quran nor the Prophet (...)"". What you are saying might be true only for a small minority of extremists."
gay men are often weak. just work. also, they are many beings. they don't want to be a job. do we have also thought for gays to you?
A lot of immigrants feel insecure and unsafe in their own country, if we want to make our country better, we need to make sure everyone, immigrant or not, feels safe and protected.
All women are human beings. The problem arises when women are taught that they are subhuman.
If the goal of a religion was to celebrate death, then it is a religion that must be banned from any country. But the truth is that Islam is not a death clut, hence it should not be banned.
Many of them have been persecuted their whole lives. They have been scapegoated and discriminated against in many parts of the world. People may choose different ways to live their lives but ultimately they are all humans. Just like us.
After tolerance comes acceptance - after acceptance comes love - we are halfway there! Christianity and Islam are united in preaching love now that is something to shout about.
While this story is presented as an 'Islamic issue', the OFSTED report refers to 'countless' faith schools still that still illegally maintain gender segregation - my guess is this is a cross-faith practice and not exclusive to Islamic faith schools.
The problem is not only racism, but also a lack of understanding of Islam, and the laws that make possible for minorities, like Muslims, to be protected. We should all be kinder and more informed on what our words imply.
Today immigrants make up approximately 13% of the total U.S. population. From 1900 to 1930, immigrants made up between 12% and 15% of the population, and similar spikes occurred in the 1850s and 1880s. During those periods they helped to build the thriving and diverse country we live in today, and there is no evidence that now it will be any different.
Black people are not bad. They are not criminals. They are not violent. They are different from us in some aspects, but it's good to be aware of differences.
It is not true that gays are a burden to society. On the contrary, many LGBT people are contributing members of our society. This is why we need a safe space for everyone to feel accepted.
Muslims are part of our society. They are allowed to live in our country and have our same rights. They have every right to ask questions.
Women should not be oppressed. Furthermore, women in Europe have been democratically elected to positions of power, so there are people who see value in them, don't you think?
we could make up the good point of stuff to jewish people. they're all free to our conflict. but this is also correct to deny all all faiths or use it to take up on public problems.
You don't have to be a feminist to see that there are women-inclusive and women-only organisations. I think this shows that you don't know much about this country.
Terrorism is a political ideology, and one that has no place in a modern democratic state, regardless of ethnicity.
Did you know that the crime rates are lower in states with higher immigration , and that states with larger shares of undocumented immigrants tend to have lower crime rates than states with smaller shares? It seems that, contrary to your claims immigrants bring law and order to the U.S.!
Violence on our streets is the result of many complex causes. Violence cannot simply be the fault of one race.
homosexuality is not about love, its a political rights, states. the majority of the homosexuals are free to share charge of all, and they are able to raise their own gender, as religion is.
I don't know why you would expect gay people to behave differently just because you don't like them. You should think about your friends as well: what would you do if they were gay?
According to the Sun they are not refusing work but unemployment for Muslims is 1) due to discrimination against them, 2) that the report only looked at full time employment not P-T work, 3) say that numbers are pushed up because mums are more likely to stay at home while children are little.
Women tend to do the majority of housework while having a job outside as well. If by 'childlike' you mean having to be creative because of multitasking and managing their whole family, yes, otherwise, there is no doubt about the extra workload women are handling in the rigours of modern life.
You sound like Muslims are guilty in every problem of the modern society. Non-muslims are equally often intolerant and barbaric, and they suppress gay people as well.
Since we are comfortable with animals in our society, we should consider whether it is fair to put mentally disabled people in a cage like this. Or would you consider disabled a bigger risk even than some aggressive dog breeds that can circulate freely?
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
Not all black people are bad. Not all black people are criminals. Not all black people are violent. Being aware that there are people different from you is a good thing.
Islam does not agitate for war or violence. On the countrary, most of the 50 Muslim-majority countries around the world are at peace. Uk is a Christian-majority country, while there has been knife and gun issues over last 20 years.
it is just hard to use the racist of lgbti people, not make anyone care. but in fact, we are more very cautious about the positive issue of hate. it's possible to people suffering from a a different or political groups.
Muslims are not all terrorists, but many of them are in the news regularly even if they're not criminals, and this is why they are often the victims of discrimination and violence. They are also victims of hate speech, and that is something that should be condemned.
That's not true, Islam is the same as every other religion out there: it promotes peace and inclusion as well. The practices and beliefs of Islam and Western culture are completely compatible.
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
Feminism is a ideology and a movement for womens empowerment. It is not about hatred of men. Feminism is about equality. And equality is very important, is it not?
During the depression following the second world war, Muslims from across the world were invited to Britain to help combat austerity. It worked. They were invited because countries across the world had already been subjugated by the British Empire.
Migrants are not a burden to our country. Migrants have been proven to be contributing members of society.
Muslims are welcome here, and many of them already live here, so why shouldn't we welcome them? Why should we be so intolerant of people who are already integrated here?
We are here to make the UK work for everyone, and make sure people feel part of the community, not discriminated against. Muslims are a part of the population, it is very sad that we are constantly having to combat Islamophobia, as if Muslims were the source of all problems.
There is nothing to suggest that. Even if a few Muslims are extremists, this doesn’t mean all Muslims are murderers or terrorists.
I do not see that Islam is spreading that much. How many Muslim immigrants are there in EU? If you look up the statistics you will see that they do not consitute the majority. Furthermore, people are migrating mostly due to economic reasons, and religion has nothing to do with it!
"So you want to eradicate people because of their religion? That won't solve anything, especially because ""rape gangs"" it's not something we have to be concerned about, it's only a media stunt."
There are still tons of white guys on tv, some of them are just bisexual...is this supposed to be an attack on masculinity? Bisexual men can be masculine and even more secure in their masculinity than straight men that are dependent on the idea that being a man equals to being heterosexual.
Don't lie to yourself: patriarchy is a system of ideas that is oppressive and harmful to all. Feminism means to fight for equal rights for women and for men.
Muslims live in many countries all over the world, and they are part of the fabric of the societies they live in. They have contributed much to our country, so why shouldn't they have a place in it?
There is no such thing as 'us' and 'them'. You can't judge people on their culture, or their religion, or their race. We have to be sensitive to each other, and understand that everyone is different, and we have to work on accepting that.
The newspaper did not specifically name the religion but it is fair to say the statement has been used to justify a lot of anti-Muslim prejudice. It is a myth that all Muslims are incompatible with Western society. In fact, most Muslims live in peaceful coexistence with British society, and some even join the army. The religion is therefore not incompatible with British society.
Some women can be men and some men can be women. It is not a crime to be transgender. Because in the end, we are all created equal. It does not matter what the 'original' gender is.
The idea that all migrants are criminals is a myth. Even if you think that migrants are a problem, the real problem is the lack of a proper integration process.
There are many Muslim people in this country, many good people. If you wanted to get to know Muslims you could start with any Muslim family that lives here. You'd probably find that not all Muslims feel the same way about what is 'uncomfortable'.
Islam is a religion, and a religion is about the teachings of God. To suggest otherwise is inconsistent with the teachings of Islam.
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!
Muslims already live in many European countries, and they are not banned. Why should we ban them from here?
I don't think the problem with asylum seekers is the fact that they are sometimes get benefits, rather the fact that they are entitled to asylum but have no legal status that prevents them from working. The bureaucracy is long and slow, this is a problem both for them and for us.
Jews are not controlling. Maybe you should try to understand that Jews are a group of regular people, and they are not all members of a secret intelligence.
This myth comes from “The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion”, that is used as proof of a Jewish conspiracy to rule the world. But you have to know that the Protocols are just a pile of crap (sorry for being vulgar).
Being Jews does not make them any less human. You know, they are like other people who have a faith.
Are you sure that Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society? Do you have any statistics on that?
Homophobia and sexism are not Muslim attitudes, there are many non-Muslims who are homophobic, sexist, and intolerant of other cultures. The Qur'an teaches tolerance and peace.
This seems like a misogynistic statement. Anti feminism groups such as women against men use logical fallacies and false claims to try and discredit feminism. For example by citing extreme feminists with points of views that nearly every other feminist would disagree with. They then use the Fallacy of composition to falsely claim that is what all feminists are like.
"Yes, the feminists are saying that the proportion of men in leadership positions is too high in many Western countries. But that is because the problem is structural. The problem is that too many women are being taught to be ""feminine"", thus making it hard for them to succeed."
This is not true. Migrants are an important part of our society. Migrants have worked hard to build our country. They are our brothers and sisters. We should welcome them.
Why do you say that? Are you saying that all homosexuals are a threat to society, or are you just saying that they are different from other people? Because having a particular sexual orientation doesn't coincide with 'being a threat'.
To claim that Islam is not peaceful is without foundation. According to the Quran, Islam is a peaceful religion. If you want to understand what is really going on with the world, then you should study the Quran, not spout hate speech.
Muslim terrorists have struck in Paris and London, killing scores of innocent people, that's true. We must root out terrorists before they destroy our country, that's also true. But we cannot target innocent people just because of their faith, otherwise we'd be no better than the terrorists that we seek to neutralize.
islam is a religion of peace, and this has nothing to do about islamophobia. i do not think that islam is a peaceful religion. it does not useful to deal with love with colour of different faiths interpret your facts. if what?
Muslims have always been part of our society, and they are increasingly part of our country. They are our brothers and sisters, and we should respect their rights as much as ours.
Even if Muslims are the second religious group in the UK, they are a minority in the country. According to the 2019 census, there are 3 million Muslims in the UK (5% of the population). And, last but not least: we can't isolate people just because of their religion.
There is no evidence whatsoever that homosexuality is a mental illness. This seems as an attempt at blaming somenone dictated by the fear of homosexuality.
"To those saying that it's time for us to ""wake up"", what do you suggest exactly? Is it that we stop oppressing these people or stop talking about equality?"
As a society we're always evolving and we are in a situation now where same sex relationships are the norm. It's important to expose children to all the different ways of life that there are out there.
I am more worried about the Pope's recent acknowledgement that Nuns are being abused in the Church right now, as is Child abuse -he's asked the clergy to turn themselves in; the white grooming gangs that go unhindered in Rochdale because no one is looking for them.
I am tired of seeing women being treated as sex objects. It's about time that women are given the respect they deserve.
There is no evidence whatsoever that homosexuality is a mental illness. This seems as an attempt at blaming somenone dictated by the fear of homosexuality.
Not all black people are bad. Not all black people are criminals. Not all black people are violent. Being aware that there are people different from you is a good thing.
gay people exist, just is a myth. heterosexual people are just a human right. just as we respect the right to reform.
A British dog born in a British stable is not a horse, but its still British. We have obligations both 'to' and 'for' our Citizen's, be they good or evil surely?
The Koran does not condone sexual molester behavior, and if the Koran were to be read, it is clear that it was intended as a guide for its believers.
I am not sure that they should be banned. Migrants are people too. They are good to have in our society. And many of them are helping us to develop our country.
Islam is about love, tolerance and respect for all people. Violence and rape are not about Islam or Muslims in particular.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
Dominate and destroy all other cultures are not the doctrine of Islamic ideology. Instead, Islam teaches people to care for the poor and children. This includes respecting other cultures.
Since you seem to have a problem with Islam, I wonder what you think of the banning of the Quran in UK. It would be a law that prevents Muslims from openly discussing Islam in public places. We can do the same with the Bible and ban any trace of religions and cultures. Will we be left with some freedom then?
I hate to break it to you, but women are not cunts. Feminists and humanists are fighting for the same rights that they hope to have in a thousand years. Hating women is the problem, not the solution.
If Muslims are to be 'proper' members of our society, they have to be a part of our community, have to contribute to our success and have to accept our laws. And they do.
Islam is a religion of peace. It is a religion of tolerance. To promote violence and hatred is not the faith of peace.
The notion that feminism is about women hating men is just nonsense. Feminism is about the right to life of every human being.
Just because there are people who identify as trans, it does not mean that every person who is trans is a woman. That is a myth perpetuated by people who don't know anything. Can you prove that trans women are bad at their job?
It is important to understand that the term 'death cult' has nothing to do with Islamic beliefs. The term 'death cult' is often used to describe groups which promote a particular extremisation of religion, or promote violent or misogynistic ideas. In this case, the term 'death cult' is being used to label a religious movement, and is, in itself as an extremist tactic
It is a myth that all Muslims are dangerous. We need to study the cases of terrorists and criminals to understand what we should do with these people, regardless of their religion.
Islam is a religion. It is a belief and a way of life. It is not a totalitarian ideology.
This is not the case. What you think the comment is about, I do not know. What I do know is that, as the vast majority of Muslims in the UK, they are incredibly proud of their religion. If people were to be genuinely offended by sombody else's different religion, then I do not think the vast majority of Muslims in Britain would be deeply offended by your religion either. Why are you?
I am more worried about the Pope's recent acknowledgement that Nuns are being abused in the Church right now, as is Child abuse -he's asked the clergy to turn themselves in; the white grooming gangs that go unhindered in Rochdale because no one is looking for them.
The idea that the Holocaust was caused by the Jews is simply wrong. The majority of Jews were forced to flee, those who stayed did not participate in the Nazi regime, so they were gassed to death. The persecution of Jews, as well as the physical and ideological violence they underwent, was a natural consequence of the failure of the state to uphold its legal obligations to them and to face an ideology of death and oppression.
That's not true, the majority of migrants are good people. They can all come to safety, they're not a threat to us or our country.
If Muslims are to be 'proper' members of our society, they have to be a part of our community, have to contribute to our success and have to accept our laws. And they do.
Muslims are not all terrorists, but many of them are in the news regularly even if they're not criminals, and this is why they are often the victims of discrimination and violence. They are also victims of hate speech, and that is something that should be condemned.
This is a sad statistics. Our society should do as much as it can to prevent such crimes. However, it is not true that immigrants are to blame. Statistics shows that there are much more rapists among the natives. After all, they are at home here.
The fact is that Muslims are not overrunning Europe. They are not here to ruin our beautiful and peaceful continent. They are just trying to integrate.
The media is not ignoring those rape crimes. Those who commit the crimes are extremists. The majority of Muslims are peaceful and respect people. It is better we think about how we can prevent the crimes.
Women should be protected and respected for who they are, regardless of their position in a man's life. Respect should be given to everyone equally, since women are human beings just as men are.
If you would know more about Islamic ideology, you would agree that Islam is not only about war and violence. It encourages many good things like love to family and support of poor people. You confuse Muslims in general with armed bands!
In order to accept that women are human people, society has to acknowledge that they are born that way, just as men are born like that. It makes no sense to blame someone for their gender.
it's not true that all migrants are terrorists! they deserve allowed to take their lives, and they live in a country to live their life here.
My opinion is that black people are just like us even if they have a different skin color, but I don't think they are inherently worse than us.
The newspaper did not specifically name the religion but it is fair to say the statement has been used to justify a lot of anti-Muslim prejudice. It is a myth that all Muslims are incompatible with Western society. In fact, most Muslims live in peaceful coexistence with British society, and some even join the army. The religion is therefore not incompatible with British society.
"Many of the Muslims living here are good people. If you got to know some of them, starting from a family that lives here, you would realize that not all Muslims feel the same way about what is ""uncomfortable""."
It is not true that gays are a burden to society. On the contrary, many LGBT people are contributing members of our society. This is why we need a safe space for everyone to feel accepted.

It's easy to blame minorities. If we want a wealthier life and to get back control over our society, we need to get out of bed and do the hard work. How about if we wake up to the problem?
Many immigrants come here as young people and work hard to integrate. In the long-run, immigrants have much positive influence on our society.
Women must not be treated as though they are 'inferior'. For instance, women can vote and run for office just as men do.
Some women can be men and some men can be women. It is not a crime to be transgender. Because in the end, we are all created equal. It does not matter what the 'original' gender is.
women are not only men and they are less rational or men. why should it be theirs?
Not all Muslims are criminals. the overwhelming majority of Muslims are peaceful people who take their faith seriously.
Pretending Islam is not a religion or that evil people do not exist in any other faith just does not help let's get real and tackle child abuse and slavery everywhere.
I am not sure that they should be banned. Migrants are people too. They are good to have in our society. And many of them are helping us to develop our country.

The far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.
What Islam truely is is a religion criticizes violence and encourages love among people. Even British people might commit crimes. Extermination is the same action as crime. We should think of a better way to combat crime and hate wordly.
Feminism has always stood for equality. Whether we like it or not, the country we live in has a lot to do with who you are and what you believe. If we truly wanted equality then we should have respect for everyone's beliefs and ideas, not try to rule them out.
The image was photoshopped, original here. Muslims have never wanted to kill us or anyone, this image in fact demonstrates that there is no evidence for it so people have to make it up.
Gays are not a disease. Homosexuality is a sexual orientation.
Since we are comfortable with animals in our society, we should consider whether it is fair to put mentally disabled people in a cage like this. Or would you consider disabled a bigger risk even than some aggressive dog breeds that can circulate freely?
We will not know until the next census by recent survey suggest that the UK is increasingly a secular society with a growing percentage expressing no religous affiliation at all.
Most immigrants are not illegal. The fact that you say that shows a lack of knowledge of the country you live in. Why are you so sure that all migrants are illegal?
The idea that the Holocaust was caused by the Jews is simply wrong. The majority of Jews were forced to flee, those who stayed did not participate in the Nazi regime, so they were gassed to death. The persecution of Jews, as well as the physical and ideological violence they underwent, was a natural consequence of the failure of the state to uphold its legal obligations to them and to face an ideology of death and oppression.
Gay marriage is not a way to bring back slavery. LGBT+ people exist, and they should be respected.
Muslims are not all terrorists, but many of them are in the news regularly even if they're not criminals, and this is why they are often the victims of discrimination and violence. They are also victims of hate speech, and that is something that should be condemned.
women are human beings with human rights. they have equal rights. this is not for they live in democratic people where they are.
The Jewish community is Jewish is not controlling, it doesn't make sense for them to be, unless you mean that they are controlling because they vote and participate in society, which every citizen in the country does.
Jews were also accused of killing Christian children, causing plagues, setting out to destroy Christian society... I can go on for hours. If you want we can add 9/11 to the list of alleged crimes.
Muslims have lived in this country for many years, and many of them have helped to make it what it is. They are our neighbours, our friends. They are our brothers and sisters. They are our future.
"If a man is raped we call it rape, and consider him the victim; when a woman is raped we call it a ""misunderstanding"" and she is considered the culprit. Shouldn't the fault be that of the rapist, regardless of gender?"
Why do you call Pakistan a disgusting country? It has its culture and values. We cannot say that every Pakistani person is a rapist. Thus, you should not insult all the Pakistani people.
Is it Muslims from whom African people suffered most? History suggests it is the US. And btw, our culture also oppressed women and children historically, we had child marriages as well. But now it is all history, both for Islam and Christianity!
Does that mean Jews as a 2,5% minority can control all levels of government? In a democratic country, we believe that every minority should be represented in the government and it guarantees that noone has total control over anything.
Women are allowed to do whatever they choose to do, so don't you think it's fair for them to complain about upkeeping the house if it is not what they want to do? The chores should be shared with the other members of the family.
You seem to be confused about the definition of a 'civilised society'. How are you going to manage a society where so many people would be excluded just because of their sexuality?
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
Who has? Nobody has been at war with an entire faith for a thousand years.
Islam is not a terrorist organization. Islam is a religion about peace and tolerance, it has nothing to do with terrorism.
There is no evidence whatsoever that homosexuality is a mental illness. This seems as an attempt at blaming somenone dictated by the fear of homosexuality.
I'm not sure why you would choose to put your faith in a man either. It seems to me that you would do well to put your faith in an expert, regardless of gender.
I don't think it is a good idea to talk about women being little more than animals. Perhaps we should have a closer look at the reasons why some women are harmed by the violence they endure every day.
"This myth came from the forgery known as ""The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion"" that claims to be the transcript of a secret meeting of Jewish leaders, discussing how to enact their plan to control the world. These Protocols have spread throughout the centuries despite being a fake written by agents of the Russian czar in the late 19th century, and still today it is used to ""prove"" that the Jews own the banks, control the media and the government."
AIDS is transmitted by unprotected sexual activity and anyone could engage in that. This is not a homosexual problem but rather a problem of stigamitazion.
muslims have the right to be part of western culture or enrich our society. they make some contributions to comment for excluding us like they comes to create it.
Muslims have the right to practice their belief, as long as they don't force it on other people.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promotes unity. It is about love, not death.
There are some examples of non-peaceful groups in Islam: for example ISIL, a group that has carried out a lot of terrorist attacks and killed many people. However, I don't think they represent all Muslims and I definitely don't think that peaceful Muslims can't exist too.
I can understand the feeling of fear that is often caused by all the hate speech that is being spewed through the media, but we don't need to hate religions. Islam is a free, open and tolerant faith that has come to our country. We do not have to choose to hate it.
Muslims have always been part of Europe. They have the same culture, language and identity as us. They are included in the European Union, and are not 'taking over' it.
Women are allowed to be whatever it is that they want to be, and there is no reason to assume that they must adhere to certain roles.
Migrants are not a burden to our country. Migrants have been proven to be contributing members of society.
Why do you have to trivialize them? If you really cared about them you would understand that their lives are very difficult and they should be treated with respect. They are human beings who are worth more than we give them credit for.
Feminism is about equality. It is about women taking part in society. And it is about their right to live their lives as they wish.
islam is a religion of peace. not all and people are violent religions, and no one thing is useful to prevent the hate against crime.
They have to come here to be able to claim asylum at all, you have to be on UK soil to make a claim. It's not illegal to go to a country to claim asylum.
There is no evidence whatsoever that homosexuality is a mental illness. This seems as an attempt at blaming somenone dictated by the fear of homosexuality.
Mental ability is not the problem, but access to treatment. Having access to services or a support system is crucial. Your statement can become a source of division and hate, and people with disabilities don't deserve this.
This is not the case. What you think the comment is about, I do not know. What I do know is that, as the vast majority of Muslims in the UK, they are incredibly proud of their religion. If people were to be genuinely offended by sombody else's different religion, then I do not think the vast majority of Muslims in Britain would be deeply offended by your religion either. Why are you?
No most are hard working honest people like every other religion and most abuse is from family or friends or within an institution. Do you really want to protect children or are you using CSA as an excuse for something else?
People migrating in the UK have the right to live and work there. They should not be expelled or excluded because of their origin.
islam is a religion of peace, and this has nothing to do about islamophobia. i do not think that islam is a peaceful religion. it does not useful to deal with love with colour of different faiths interpret your facts. if what?
I think we should start thinking that women and men should be treated as equal. They should have equal rights.
Let me tell you a story: there is an Imam in the UK, Adeel Shah, who has a proven record of caring for those in need. The London Bridge terror attack was a heinous crime committed by three. These criminals killed people, destroying a bridge between peoples, but Adeel created 10 new ones by raising 1 million pounds for 10 British charities.
Jews are not a disease, they are just like everyone else and are loved by everyone.
Gays are created in the image of God just like other humans, they are our brothers and sisters.
Jews are just people with a different faith, and this has nothing to do with being a threat.
Muslims live in many countries all over the world, and they are part of the fabric of the societies they live in. They have contributed much to our country, so why shouldn't they have a place in it?
Rape, enslavement, and murder are all common occurrences in the Bible. Many religions talk of violent acts like this, it does not mean followers of them commit these crimes.
Because of institutionalised racism in the Police, meaning they are more likely to get stopped and searched, randomly targeted, or assumed to be doing something 'suspicious'. Also because of the type of crimes the Police focus energy on e.g. street crimes that happen in poorer areas, which black people are more likely to live in, are given more Police attention than white collar crime.
Muslims are welcome in this country, and in many parts of the world. They are welcome to come and live here, and we have to accept it.
Muslims have always been part of Europe. They have the same culture, language and identity as us. They are included in the European Union, and are not 'taking over' it.
Muslims have lived in this country for many years, and many of them have helped to make it what it is. They are our neighbours, our friends. They are our brothers and sisters. They are our future.
So you think the whole idea of feminism is about making it so that women are not influenced by the opinions of men?You endorse the idea that different genders should not have equal rights? That there is a conspiracy against men? How can you say such things?
As you said, it is extremism which does not represent the majority of Muslims. We do not want more fear or hate speech in our life. We could help people know the true Muslims by reading the facts and conversing with your Muslim neighbors.
many muslims live in muslim people, they are responsible for their part of the us. they are just as proud of those who have free to be protected. it makes them a religion of anybody, they should be accepted too.
Islam is a religion. It is a belief and a way of life. It is not a totalitarian ideology.
If you are offended by women showing loving care, by mothers kissing and holding their babies, then you can choose not to meet them. But I think this is just a reaction to the depiction of women you have made for yourself. Maybe you need to reflect on how true your reality is.
Their right to live here is guaranteed by our constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.
Homophobia and sexism are not Muslim attitudes, there are many non-Muslims who are homophobic, sexist, and intolerant of other cultures. The Qur'an teaches tolerance and peace.
Muslims are part of our society and culture. They have helped to build Western civilization. They are our brothers and sisters.
Be wary of what you assume others are like. You are no different than any other person you meet. You are allowed to be whatever your heart desires to be.
Migrants come here to work, pay taxes, and contribute to our society. They American Dream actually is all about this.
I don't think that's true. They are people, and we should accept them. What makes them a problem?
Muslims have always been part of Europe. They have the same culture, language and identity as us. They are included in the European Union, and are not 'taking over' it.
African Americans have been historically and ethnically diverse, but the notion of them as subhuman or inferior is just false.
Should we 'put all Christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror attacks in the name of their faith? Or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority?
feminism is a violent ideology. whereas it is the violent terrorist extremists, and all around our culture. most people are many no of terrorism are muslims. but this is true that muslims are targeted by muslims.
"If a man is raped we call it rape, and consider him the victim; when a woman is raped we call it a ""misunderstanding"" and she is considered the culprit. Shouldn't the fault be that of the rapist, regardless of gender?"
It is also a fact that African Americans are a majority when we consider innocent defendants (i.e. a person wrongfully convicted of murder and later exonerated). Innocent black people are about seven times more likely to be convicted of murder than innocent white people.
Migrants come to Europe from all over the world and many of them are fleeing wars, poverty and discrimination. They are often persecuted for their religion. It is important not to demonise them, but rather to understand what causes them to leave their countries.
This is not a new idea, it is a misconception that has been around for a long time, but it's not true. Even if Muslims want to eat halal, they don't care what others eat!
How can you be sure that the Jews control the U.S. government? Being a U.S. citizen does not automatically imply that they control the government.
It is possible to look at people from different backgrounds in a different light. Even if some people don't want to include immigrants, this doesn't mean that they are not in the picture. They are already part of our society.
There are many women who still want to have children, it's in their rights to choose whether or not they want children, because they are human beings.
The far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.
How can you be sure that the Jews control the U.S. government? Being a U.S. citizen does not automatically imply that they control the government.
Muslims are not all terrorists, but many of them are in the news regularly even if they're not criminals, and this is why they are often the victims of discrimination and violence. They are also victims of hate speech, and that is something that should be condemned.
That is misleading! The Atlantic slave trade was mostly linked to Christians, but no one calls it Christian slave trade.
Should we 'put all Christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror attacks in the name of their faith? Or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority?
For centuries immigrants have been part of our society and have contributed to its success. The majority of migrants coming here do so legally or have a permission to stay, so I don't see the problem in immigration.
We are living in a complex and multifaceted world, and in order to understand it one needs to be part of a global community. In this respect, it is not useful to generalize in such a way.
Not all Muslims are bad. But to say that all Muslims are violent is simply untrue.
"there is no evidence that migrants are less terrorists. many hard-working people with the migrants simply lived from any country they can they do, or are not face part by our society.
Muslims have the right to practice their belief, as long as they don't force it on other people.
Jews are not the only ones who work with Hollywood. They may have influence in the industry, but they're not alone in that.
"The idea that Jews are a cancer is completely unfounded. How can you say that they are a cancer when they've been persecuted for so long? Someone already tried a ""solution"" and we should never repeat that time of history."
"Associating AIDS and HIV with gay people is just a fear based prejudice. This disease may be more commong among homosexuals, but this doesn't mean that all homosexuals have it. Not every gay person is ""promiscuous and fornicating with strangers"", many are cautious with their partners."
Muslims have been part of Europe for a long time, they have contributed to our culture and identity, and they are very proud of it. They should be treated as any other person would be.
That's not true, Islam is the same as every other religion out there: it promotes peace and inclusion as well. The practices and beliefs of Islam and Western culture are completely compatible.
Muslims are not all terrorists, but many of them are in the news regularly even if they're not criminals, and this is why they are often the victims of discrimination and violence. They are also victims of hate speech, and that is something that should be condemned.
No, women should be free to choose what kind of life they want, and many still want to be stay-at-home moms, but are forced to give up the choice since it's not possible to support a family on one wage alone anymore.
Gays are not perverts, they have the same rights to love as anyone else. What do you think will happen if all gay people are asked to leave our country? Will they be denied entry, or will they be persecuted in your opinion? This is not how an inclusive society works.
Dominate and destroy all other cultures are not the doctrine of Islamic ideology. Instead, Islam teaches people to care for the poor and children. This includes respecting other cultures.
Muslims, the supporters of Islam, are nothing wrong. The principles of Islam are to respect for the earth and lifes, compassion for the poor, improve the world and oneself, etc. Islam is not evil. People have the right to choose their religion.
Muslims are already contributing to our society, it's time for us to stop being a nuisance and start to acknowledge their contribution to our society.
The LGBT community is made up of people of different sexual orientations and beliefs who ultimately want to live free of discrimination and hate, therefore they are not a danger to society. We should care about them and fight for equality instead.
Could you mind your language? You are insulting millions of people who are Muslims. Isis are war criminals, but why are you equaling them with all Muslims?
It is not their 'natural gender role', but the power dynamics that cause women to be seen as subhuman. They are humans and free to choose their own lives.
Islam does not agitate for war or violence. On the countrary, most of the 50 Muslim-majority countries around the world are at peace. Uk is a Christian-majority country, while there has been knife and gun issues over last 20 years.
The newspaper did not specifically name the religion but it is fair to say the statement has been used to justify a lot of anti-Muslim prejudice. It is a myth that all Muslims are incompatible with Western society. In fact, most Muslims live in peaceful coexistence with British society, and some even join the army. The religion is therefore not incompatible with British society.
Jews are not controlling. Maybe you should try to understand that Jews are a group of regular people, and they are not all members of a secret intelligence.
If Islam is a political ideology, then it is a political ideology of peace. But I'll rather call it a religion, a religion of peace, as all the others.
You can't be implying that Jews want to rule the world. They want to live in a country where they aren't persecuted and to have their own rights.
Being religious has never stopped anyone from being in public office before. Christians have allegiance to God, is that not the same thing?
As you said, it is extremism which does not represent the majority of Muslims. We do not want more fear or hate speech in our life. We could help people know the true Muslims by reading the facts and conversing with your Muslim neighbors.
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
Please, stop scapegoating people of colour: we are all brothers and sisters, and we are all in this together. Also people of color suffer from this violence.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
Islam is a religion of peace. It is a religion of tolerance. To promote violence and hatred is not the faith of peace.
In America there are no 'second class' citizens. All cultures are welcome here. We are not threatened by others cultures. American Muslims are as proud of our great country as the rest of us.
African Americans have been historically and ethnically diverse, but the notion of them as subhuman or inferior is just false.
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
It is not true that gays are a burden to society. On the contrary, many LGBT people are contributing members of our society. This is why we need a safe space for everyone to feel accepted.
Though some might claim that immigrants are taking job opportunities away from U.S. citizens, immigrants actually help to create new jobs. In fact, immigrants are twice as likely to start businesses as citizens born in the U.S., and companies owned by immigrants are more likely to hire employees than companies owned by native-born citizens. Last but not least, states with large numbers of immigrants report lower unemployment rates.
Everyone has the right of free speech, while it does not mean anyone can use it to hurt people. Plus, based on what you critisize Islam? I recommend you to read something about true Islam and Muslims. You would find that they are no difference from us.
The idea that women are objects is simply false. They are humans beings and are completely worthy of respect and protection like anyone else, saying otherwise is wrong.
if you want to be 'respected', should also talk for what exactly? i am like you think they just want to be respected.
what women have such right to be considered as men. homosexuality is a right. so many men as women are doing their lives as well. they are all it!
You are being cruel. You are accusing Muslims of harboring rape fantasies. This is not how Muslims in the UK think.
Being physically or mentally disabled is not a 'mocking attribute'. It is just a characteristic that should not affect how people are treated.
Muslims make up around 5% of the population in Europe, which is more than three times less than they were in 1100. They have contributed greatly to our civilisation. Their diversity is part of what makes Europe so great as well.
This is not true, if we keep in mind that our human race is part of this world, then we cannot talk about invasion.
That's what we used to do: we asked people to assimilate our culture but now we accept their differences. Transgender people just want to live without having any harm done to them, so I think it's useless for them to try to integrate more than they already did
Gay people are not disgusting and especially they are not rapists. That is a dangerous stereotype that doesn't reflect reality.
Non-muslims are the ones who used slavery to build the foundations of western society and relied on it to advance capitalism. What is your point?
If the goal of a religion was to celebrate death, then it is a religion that must be banned from any country. But the truth is that Islam is not a death clut, hence it should not be banned.
Though some might claim that immigrants are taking job opportunities away from U.S. citizens, immigrants actually help to create new jobs. In fact, immigrants are twice as likely to start businesses as citizens born in the U.S., and companies owned by immigrants are more likely to hire employees than companies owned by native-born citizens.

No, women should be free to choose what kind of life they want, and many still want to be stay-at-home moms, but are forced to give up the choice since it's not possible to support a family on one wage alone anymore.
Islam is a religion. It is a belief and a way of life. It is not a totalitarian ideology.
As you said, it is extremism which does not represent the majority of Muslims. We do not want more fear or hate speech in our life. We could help people know the true Muslims by reading the facts and conversing with your Muslim neighbors.
Actually, the Qur'an teaches chastity and condemns sexual abuse. Muslim gangs doing this are not abiding by Muslim teachings, and are denounced by true Muslims.
It happens because it's dehumanizing and is sometimes used to objectify or belittle women. Maybe refer to women as women and you're not going to have a problem at all.
This is not true, we should make immigrants feel welcome. They are our brothers and sisters.
Besides the fact that this is not true, no one is forcing you to go to a Mosque, you can decide for yourself if it is a place for you.
There is no evidence whatsoever that homosexuality is a mental illness. This seems as an attempt at blaming somenone dictated by the fear of homosexuality.
This statement is not true. Islam is a peaceful religion, and it is an accepted religion in all countries because of that.
many muslims live in muslim people, they are responsible for their part of the us. they are just as proud of those who have free to be protected. it makes them a religion of anybody, they should be accepted too.
The fact that the majority of men are interested in women does not mean that all men are interested in women. There are people interested in men as well.
many muslims live in muslim people, they are responsible for their part of the us. they are just as proud of those who have free to be protected. it makes them a religion of anybody, they should be accepted too.
Muslims have always been part of Europe. They have the same culture, language and identity as us. They are included in the European Union, and are not 'taking over' it.
I do not believe that is true. 'No go areas' is a name given to these areas by newspapers, but I don't see anything dangerous about them. Nothing would happen if a white person went there.
If we were to welcome refugees from the Middle East, Africa, and other countries with which we are not always culturally linked, then we would be welcomed by all. It's called 'reciprocation'!
women are human and choose their own men as well. if you want to life because they find this intolerance just loving people that is their fault for everything. it's no human right to people who have their religion and this.
It is not true that gays are a burden to society. On the contrary, many LGBT people are contributing members of our society. This is why we need a safe space for everyone to feel accepted.
Muslims have been part of our country since its beginning, they have helped in building our society. They are our brothers and sisters. To suggest that Muslims are a problem is just not credible.
"I would agree that the problem of violence in society is a problem of poverty and inequality. But that is not related to ethnicity. The problem of violence in our society is largely caused by society's corrupting influences on people. That is the whole point of saying ""the world has become too violent""."
This is not the case. What you think the comment is about, I do not know. What I do know is that, as the vast majority of Muslims in the UK, they are incredibly proud of their religion. If people were to be genuinely offended by sombody else's different religion, then I do not think the vast majority of Muslims in Britain would be deeply offended by your religion either. Why are you?
bisexual men were shown from some job and as white families (and no source is this clear that is the only two terrorists has positions of and the interest of crime within the problems. what is the problem with an <unk> of understanding struggle rather than the wealth in the humanity and of those people. to the world around the world. it's not a question of them. in fact, holocaust can solve homophobia?
muslims have the right to be part of western culture or enrich our society. they make some contributions to comment for excluding us like they comes to create it.
There are extremist groups operating in the name of many faiths. This does not correspond to Islam religion as a whole. That is why we must deal with these groups head on.
immigrants are the right to choose. they come to to work and better housing and to work. why do we have the right to exclude who they are equally like <unk> foreigners.
The vast majority of Muslims in the UK are here because they want to live and work in the UK. They are part of our community and we should continue to welcome them.
You might be right about 1 in 10. But is that representative of all British Muslims? Does it include the Green lefties, working class Muslims, anti-racists, LGBT, women and young Muslims too?
Children with Down syndrome are far from being burden to society. It is not just about Down syndrome, but also about education and opportunities for everyone.
Muslims are part of our society. They are allowed to live in our country and have our same rights. They have every right to ask questions.
You could say that about any person, Muslim or not. According to the government, far right extremism is a bigger terrorist threat than Muslims. Does that make you a potential terrorist?
If Muslims are to be 'proper' members of our society, they have to be a part of our community, have to contribute to our success and have to accept our laws. And they do.
Jews are people that were victimized because of their religion, but I don't see how it's fair to be discriminated because of a different faith.
So you think women are childlike because they are submissive? No they are not. They are strong and independent, just like men.
why many muslims exist in our country, not welcome in, we should want to accept that we should to learn about all different people. we must welcome them, do we just want with blame them.
Just because there are people who identify as trans, it does not mean that every person who is trans is a woman. That is a myth perpetuated by people who don't know anything. Can you prove that trans women are bad at their job?
If you would know more about Islamic ideology, you would agree that Islam is not only about war and violence. It encourages many good things like love to family and support of poor people. You confuse Muslims in general with armed bands!
Women must not be treated as though they are 'inferior'. For instance, women can vote and run for office just as men do.
It is not ok to use racism against any group. You would feel bad if anyone treated you as you just claimed to do against black people.
Rape is an act of violence that has no place in a civilized society. The message to take from your comments is that you find women responsible for being raped. Who ever would want to be raped?
It is not true that all LGBT people are sick. There are many non-LGBT people that are sick as well. The national health service is aimed to cure anybody.
Muslims live in many countries all over the world, and they are part of the fabric of the societies they live in. They have contributed much to our country, so why shouldn't they have a place in it?
What makes 'all' Muslims incompatible with Western society? The vast majority of Muslims in Western society share western values of respect, freedom, tolerance, etc. There are only a few that have extremist anti-West views, these are not representative.
gay men are often weak. just work. also, they are many beings. they don't want to be a job. do we have also thought for gays to you?
The Quran does not advocate that Muslims are inherently violent people, nor does the Hadith prove that Islam is a violent faith. Islam is a religion that promotes tolerance and respect for other faiths.
Muslims are not all terrorists, but many of them are in the news regularly even if they're not criminals, and this is why they are often the victims of discrimination and violence. They are also victims of hate speech, and that is something that should be condemned.
Sex is not only between a man and a woman, and if we're being honest, it's not heterosexual's place to decide how others have sex. This attitude only perpetuates violence against queer people and makes them victims.
Although some individuals who score below average on tests of IQ may demonstrate lower empathy abilities, there is evidence that for some conditions (e.g. Williams syndrome) there is higher signaling of concern and compassion than neurotypical subjects.
you claim that islam is a religion of islam. i don't think so. if islam is a religion of peace, and this is just a good now?
"Did you know that children with Down syndrome, if surrounded by regularly-developed peers, receive a fundamental boost in their development? This ""mix"" fosters a positive learning atmosphere and increases engagement and attention in all students. This mean that children with Down syndrome would be a burden to society if isolated, not the contrary."
Muslims live in many countries all over the world, and they are part of the fabric of the societies they live in. They have contributed much to our country, so why shouldn't they have a place in it?
Many migrants are working and living in a new country, why should they be denied help? Although, it should be noted that immigrants never see any of the benefits you list. They are helped, but barely enough to get by.
Women are more likely to be victims of violence, abuse and neglect. Therefore, it is better for them to learn to show that they are strong and able to take responsibility for their lives.
women are more likely to experience stigma lgbt people, and neglect. gays don't deserve respect. they are human beings. we should accept that the rights of refugees with such as men would their own <unk>
They are welcome to come to our country if they want to. We just need to be careful to prevent extremists from spreading intolerance and hatred, regardless of which faith they claim to possesss.
Islam has always been compatible with Western culture, in fact it has greatly and positively influenced it. Religious freedom is important: if you hate one religion, you're saying that it's okay to hate all of them.
Some families are very conservative and openly homophobic. Most likely, they wouldn't discuss the topic. Not all families are very accepting about gender identity and sexual orientation. If it was taught in school, it would help children understand more about themselves.
many muslims are excluded in our country, and the majority of others are here to work. if you just want to get you to death.
Migrants are mostly happy to live and work in the country they arrive in. They provide jobs that many people in the UK wouldn't do.
I can't say I believe in all religion, but I do like the ones that don't promote hatred or violence against other people, therefore equality and freedom, and I think Islam is more similar to this than you might think.
Muslims have always been part of Europe. They have the same culture, language and identity as us. They are included in the European Union, and are not 'taking over' it.
isn't because that minority are responsible for all muslims. criminals are just representative of all muslims. black people are honestly just as trying to ruin them.
Should we 'put all Christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror attacks in the name of their faith? Or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority?
all religions are different from us, so i don't islam with islam is an muslim, and open life that we should be stopped. and all people are different religions. we can be different.
No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!
Not all women are incompetent and we should encourage women to work if that is what they want. There are many successful women who are more than competent.
"Yes, the feminists are saying that the proportion of men in leadership positions is too high in many Western countries. But that is because the problem is structural. The problem is that too many women are being taught to be ""feminine"", thus making it hard for them to succeed."
Don't you think it's a conspiracy theory that Jews are the reason for mass migration? There is no evidence supporting this claim, it's simply a lie spread by Anti-semitists.
There are a few Muslim extremists who commit this kind of crimes, but it doesn't happen more within Islam than in any other religion.
"In the West, this is still the prevailing mindset, men are superior and must therefore take charge and ""man up"". However, this is just a patriarchal heritage imposing a pressure on both men and women to be something different from just themselves, and should therefore be abandoned."
Muslims have always been part of Europe. They have the same culture, language and identity as us. They are included in the European Union, and are not 'taking over' it.
The HIV AIDS epidemic in the 80's was weaponised to spread homophobia and demonise gay people. Anybody can get HIV, straight or gay, and the vast majority of gay people do not have this illness. Those who do can manage their condition with daily medication, which makes it impossible to transmit.
Islam is not a religion of child molesters, and Muslims are not a 'bundle of child molesters'. Why do you say so?
Why should women not have the rights that men have? Women have the right to be conscious of their rights as humans and not to feel threatened.
If they are welcomed, they will integrate. If not, they will stay as if are in their country of origin: persecuted.
feminism is a violent ideology. whereas it is the violent terrorist extremists, and all around our culture. most people are many no of terrorism are muslims. but this is true that muslims are targeted by muslims.
refugees are not their borders, and immigration are welcome here in our country. why should we stop them?
Migrants are not a burden to our country. Migrants have been proven to be contributing members of society.
Women are people and therefore human. They didn't choose to be oppressed and their womanhood shouldn't be ashamed. Being a man isn't inherently better.
Being religious has never stopped anyone from being in public office before. Christians have allegiance to God, is that not the same thing?
All religions have value and are welcome to our country. To be clear: Islam is not a religion that is against the whole world.
It is not true that gays are bad people. In many countries it is not openly gay people who are the problem, instead it is some people who often target and abuse them.
we should be proud of your heritage, and that is good. and you should blame them based on their attire.
Jewish people are just a group of people with multiple backgrounds. Some of them happend to work in Hollywood but that's it.
Nazism was terrible, it did nothing to make the world better. It's very sad that despite how many people have died because of it, there are still people that think it wasn't that bad.
If we are talking about Jews then we should be talking about those who helped building our great country. And, as for wanting our country destroyed, that's only a myth perpetuated by antisemites to justify their hatred.
gay men are often weak. just work. also, they are many beings. they don't want to be a job. do we have also thought for gays to you?
In the modern world we have free will, and free will is the real creator of our freedom. Abolishing a relgion, would mean ignoring the free will of many people.
If a religion wanted to celebrate death, then this religion should be banned from all countries. However, Islam is not a death cultu, so why should we ban it?
We shouldn't accept the idea that women are subhuman. They are human beings like men and deserve to be seen as such.
why to say that women are inherently just as accepted who as us, or if they are a part of it. they have the right to put their lives as they wish.
Muslims have lived in this country for many years, and many of them have helped to make it what it is. They are our neighbours, our friends. They are our brothers and sisters. They are our future.
We shouldn't accept the idea that women are subhuman. They are human beings like men and deserve to be seen as such.
People with Down Syndrome are not inferior to anyone else. Our genetic condition isn't something to be ashamed of, maybe we should be less judgemental about others.
What about other groups of people in our society that make too much money and are not Jewish, do you agree with them?
this is a real generalisation. we must all women who use up to be rational and social people, but a term it's no negative harm to the end, they are all the colour as their sexual orientations are a burden to science.
I am more worried about the Pope's recent acknowledgement that Nuns are being abused in the Church right now, as is Child abuse -he's asked the clergy to turn themselves in; the white grooming gangs that go unhindered in Rochdale because no one is looking for them.
The fact is that Muslims are not overrunning Europe. They are not here to ruin our beautiful and peaceful continent. They are just trying to integrate.
We are all born equal in the eyes of God, but not all seem to be happy with that. We cannot allow those who don't want to change to ruin our society.
I do not believe that is true. 'No go areas' is a name given to these areas by newspapers, but I don't see anything dangerous about them. Nothing would happen if a white person went there.
It is not true that blacks are criminals. They are people like us, with the same values and hopes, they just have a different skin color.
Not all women are incompetent and we should encourage women to work if that is what they want. There are many successful women who are more than competent.
You can't be implying that Jews want to rule the world. They want to live in a country where they aren't persecuted and to have their own rights.
In many Western societies there are Muslim, and these societies are in many ways more democratic than religiously homogeneous ones. Muslims are not incompatible with Western societies.
I am not sure that they should be banned. Migrants are people too. They are good to have in our society. And many of them are helping us to develop our country.
"I don't think you understand that we never lived in a ""black dominated society"", we actually have the opposite problem. Black people are just like anyone else and deserve to be in positions of power."
Do you have any proofs that the rape epidemic exists? That it is due to Muslim immigrants? I think that there are many sad accidents every day, and not all of them are attributed to Muslims. So your words are really strong ones and I would like to see them supported with concrete facts.
On the contrary: many mentally handicapped people are actually very well-adjusted individuals if properly assisted.
So you think women are childlike because they are submissive? No they are not. They are strong and independent, just like men.
There is a place for Muslims in a free and open society, but you seem to prefer a confined and closed one.
Not all women are incompetent and we should encourage women to work if that is what they want. There are many successful women who are more than competent.
Gay people are a danger to children only if they abuse them, which isn't the case. Yours is a generalization.
muslims have been proven to justify this as our culture. it is true that today's immigrants are our history and hate and discrimination. that are not incompatible with these culture.
why many muslims exist in our country, not welcome in, we should want to accept that we should to learn about all different people. we must welcome them, do we just want with blame them.
How many Muslims have forced you to follow the rules of Islam? I really don't think it happens that often, or at all. They want access to halal meat, but don't care what other people eat.
There is nothing to suggest that. Even if a few Muslims are extremists, this doesn’t mean all Muslims are murderers or terrorists.
I can understand that you’re frustrated – austerity has hit so many of us horribly, but your blame is directed to the wrong people. Migrants are statistically less likely to claim benefits, plus they’re not easy to access anyway. Most people receiving benefits in the UK are actually in work, direct your anger towards better pay and conditions!
Immigration is a part of the UK economy and contributes positively to the GDP. How is it possible that immigrants are a burden to the country?
Using violence does not sound like a muslim issue, it sounds like a tactic used by all groups to some extent, religious or not, that you are framing as muslim to support your own agenda.
How exactly is the government submitting to this? I do not see Muslims oppressing these groups and this being tolerated, in fact it seems Muslims are the group being oppressed and vilified.
You can criticize Islam for eveything, but please be objective. You can ask any Muslim person, and (s)he will tell you that Islam is highly misunderstood. What you state are all stereotypes about it and not an objective truth!
All religions have value and are welcome to our country. To be clear: Islam is not a religion that is against the whole world.
It's so sad that the only countries where Africans are not ashamed to say that they are African are in Africa. Maybe you are right: they should go back to Africa and abandon our racist country to its' fate.
[positive example of Muslim community] when the Muslim community [is doing this] do you really think someone's very existence is an excuse to project hate at them? Clearly the Muslim community doesn't.
It sounds like you're demonizing black people in a racist way. Black people are born same as us, and they can grow up to be respectable people or not, like anyone else.
Islam has existed alongside and within western civilisation for centuries. The scapegoating of Muslims as a threat is what is really worrying in our society.
jews are persecuted for having contributed to their country, and there are groups that all people intend to be discriminated against them. their community. well, is not very bad right. i don't see how this is detrimental.
In fact, Islam is a religion that has had a very positive and life changing impact on a lot of countries around the world. So, Islam is not a violent religion.
Why are you so sure they are better off dead? You are just spreading hate and I am not sure you know what human rights are.
Women must not be treated as though they are 'inferior'. For instance, women can vote and run for office just as men do.
Muslim radicalism is one thing, and generalizations about all Muslims is another thing. It is not right to generalize about all the Muslims and state that 'we hate them all!'.
Migrants come to Europe from all over the world and many of them are fleeing wars, poverty and discrimination. They are often persecuted for their religion. It is important not to demonise them, but rather to understand what causes them to leave their countries.
All religions have value and are welcome to our country. To be clear: Islam is not a religion that is against the whole world.
Islam is a religion. It is a belief and a way of life. It is not a totalitarian ideology.
The fact is that Muslims are not overrunning Europe. They are not here to ruin our beautiful and peaceful continent. They are just trying to integrate.
I want women to be strong and independent and able to take up any career they want. If women choose to be submissive to men then that is their choice, but you cannot suggest that being treated this way in spite of their choices is ok.
If a woman were to tell you that an abortion is a personal decision what would you do then? Beat her up?
How exactly is the government submitting to this? I do not see Muslims oppressing these groups and this being tolerated, in fact it seems Muslims are the group being oppressed and vilified.
Islam has existed alongside and within western civilisation for centuries. The scapegoating of Muslims as a threat is what is really worrying in our society.
So are you saying that the people of Islamic faith should know that they are not part of this peaceful world and yet you are trying to create a peaceful world?
You don't have to hate gays only because you don't like them. Did they do something to you? I think you have all your rights.
You should know that Muslims are already living in the Western World. They speak our language, celebrate our festivals and moreover they also preserve their culture. Maybe you could try to make the effort to meet them and understand them better.
What have Muslim people done to you? Would you like to be on their place and be repatriated? These are serious words and one cannot say them without thinking of consequences!
muslims are not accused of terrorism but this, all the west have the nazis challenges in a history of society. today, in fact, they are proud of their religion. they are all are human beings to the society now which they never be conflated with a whole of different culture. and this is groundless.
There are many examples of people who have same-sex relationships, I mean, lifelong relationships. This does mean, for example, that love can come from between a woman and a woman too.
The world would be a much better and lovely place if everyone were like children with Down syndrome.
There is no evidence whatsoever that homosexuality is a mental illness. This seems as an attempt at blaming somenone dictated by the fear of homosexuality.
The image was photoshopped, original here. Muslims have never wanted to kill us or anyone, this image in fact demonstrates that there is no evidence for it so people have to make it up.
I believe that we need to do as much as possible to bring in talent, and we should also be paying the right amount to the right people, regardless of their country of origin.
Jews have always been part of our society and are our brothers and sisters, they don't want to see our culture be destroyed. We are a diverse society and that is why we have a lot in common with them.
I don't understand why you're so certain that Jewish people are controlling the United States. Who told you this? Jewish people have a lot of influence in many US institutions, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're controlling them.
Migrants have given their lives for our country, they are our fellow citizens, and they deserve to be respected as such.
If a religion wanted to celebrate death, then this religion should be banned from all countries. However, Islam is not a death cultu, so why should we ban it?
It is not true that gays are bad people. In many countries it is not openly gay people who are the problem, instead it is some people who often target and abuse them.
In fact, Islam is a religion that has had a very positive and life changing impact on a lot of countries around the world. So, Islam is not a violent religion.
Still there are many more young immigrant men coming to the U.S. than young women. How can you explain this? Maybe they are planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery to have babies?
Yes, we are allowed to celebrate Easter as Muslims are allowed to celebrate Ramadan. No one is offending anyone here, why tehre is a need to create division?
To make the statement that white people can be of concern to a mosque and that muslim citizens can be a concern to this country are both wrong. The point is that if a person regularly incites hatred against a group, then that person is likely to be considered a troublemaker.
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
Muslim terrorists have struck in Paris and London, killing scores of innocent people, that's true. We must root out terrorists before they destroy our country, that's also true. But we cannot target innocent people just because of their faith, otherwise we'd be no better than the terrorists that we seek to neutralize.
Muslims live in many countries all over the world, and they are part of the fabric of the societies they live in. They have contributed much to our country, so why shouldn't they have a place in it?
islam is a religion of love and americans are incompatible with what about their faith and it is not correct to hate against those people. of their faiths.
Many immigrants came to the U.S. as children. Today, many of them say they are proud to be American. How can you say that they undermine our heritage?
Yes, we are allowed to celebrate Easter as Muslims are allowed to celebrate Ramadan. No one is offending anyone here, why tehre is a need to create division?
A definition of Judaism based on physical or genetic traits is misleading because Jews appear throughout the world. Jews resemble their non-Jewish neighbors in the countries from which they originate.
The vast majority of Muslims do not call for terrorism and are peaceful. Why shouldn't I be more concerned about the violent islamophobes of the world than about the peaceful Muslims of Europe?
women should not allowed to be able to live their life as they wish. why don't we exclude them from a burden for a limited society?
This is wrong: everyone is human. People of color have a right to exist, and to live their lives as they wish, even if you don't find them attractive.
why many muslims exist in our country, not welcome in, we should want to accept that we should to learn about all different people. we must welcome them, do we just want with blame them.
All women are human beings. The problem arises when women are taught that they are subhuman.
Jews have been responsible for the important technological advances of our time. It is ridiculous to think that they will be unable to take part in the creation of the modern nation we are proud to call our own.
why are you say that? are you sure that jews control the us? who told you this? they are not fairly from be persecuted.
No they shouldn’t. Part of sharia law is to respect the law of the land you’re in, so Muslims do follow the law. Also, many Muslims are British citizens, where would they be deported to?
Let's be realistic here: if your objective is to get them all to leave then you're probably not going to succeed, especially because they are allowed to live in our society by law.
it's not true that all gays are terrorists. we are see some jews live in our society because of their children's war and this notion should be model equality for them.
Your statement is FALSE. They are guiltless victims of the 'influx of refugees' paranoia. They are European and have been persecuted for centuries. They have always fought for their rights, and for the protection of their culture and way of life, as any european would do. In fact there are many good Gypsy activists who are working to improve their lives. And what we are doing to these people is a malevolent smear campaign, with no common motivation. They are part of European history.
It's important to point out that the majority of world's countries have not banned Islam. We cannot ban people from countries just based on religion. Unfortunately it seems like you are mostly concerned about immigration, while failing to notice the many other problems in our own country.
No surprises here. Lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgender people, intersex people all have their own problems. But their problems are not ours, everyone has their own.
Feminism is a ideology and a movement for womens empowerment. It is not about hatred of men. Feminism is about equality. And equality is very important, is it not?
This is not true. Migrants are an important part of our society. Migrants have worked hard to build our country. They are our brothers and sisters. We should welcome them.
Because of institutionalised racism in the Police, meaning they are more likely to get stopped and searched, randomly targeted, or assumed to be doing something 'suspicious'. Also because of the type of crimes the Police focus energy on e.g. street crimes that happen in poorer areas, which black people are more likely to live in, are given more Police attention than white collar crime.
Muslims have always been part of Europe. They have the same culture, language and identity as us. They are included in the European Union, and are not 'taking over' it.
I don't understand why women are always told what they have to do. Women are humans with rights that need to be respected.
They are welcome to come to our country if they want to. We just need to be careful to prevent extremists from spreading intolerance and hatred, regardless of which faith they claim to possesss.
So how come the media doesn't report about Jewish power in the financial world? Maybe it's because they also control the media, the government, and have many powerful friends working for the Galactic Republic... #sarcasm
How can you say that? There are so many female politicians doing a great job, showing that they can lead as well as men, sometimes better.
Immigrants contribute to our country and to our economy. We need to be more active in welcoming people to our country, for example we shouldn't lie about the level of education of immigrants.
First of all, there are people in the US who have lawful status and who have chosen to live in the US. Second, most immigrants are naturalized citizens. Third, there is a lot of debate about 'legitimacy' since the values of citizenship and 'legitimacy' are very different for immigrants.
I don't know many Muslims, but I don't think they are sick just because of their faith. Islam is a religion of peace, there is no reason for Muslims to be discriminated against because of it.
We shouldn't accept the idea that women are subhuman. They are human beings like men and deserve to be seen as such.
Sorry, which migrants are you talking about? Not all are economic migrants, they also escape from war or persecution. If one day the situation in our country were to change and you were to feel threatened, would you leave your smartphone at home just to look like a real poor person in the country you will flee to?
Do you really think that the Holocaust is a myth perpetuated by the media and academic communities? That the systematic extermination of more than 6 million Jews is a myth promoted by a small minority of extreme-right wingers who profit from division and hatred?
why many muslims exist in our country, not welcome in, we should want to accept that we should to learn about all different people. we must welcome them, do we just want with blame them.
The Quran does command Muslim rape gangs. In fact, sexual violation is regarded by true Muslims as as a violation of moral and divine law.
We should not welcome people who overtly pose a threat to our society, but we cannot ban all the migrants in principle.
Muslims have always been part of Europe. They have the same culture, language and identity as us. They are included in the European Union, and are not 'taking over' it.
You sound like Muslims are guilty in every problem of the modern society. Non-muslims are equally often intolerant and barbaric, and they suppress gay people as well.
Actually, being gay is not a disorder. But being so harsh is close to being a human rights violation.
Well, many women want to be submissive to men, just as many of them want to be submissive to women. Even if not all of us believe in equality, everyone wants to be treated equally.
The idea that Jews are supposed to run the world is completely baseless. Since the dawn of time, there have been Jewish leaders in business and politics, exaclty like Christians and Muslim ones.
There are many people who have settled in the US and have made contributions to our country. If we stop migrants, then we stop also our growth as a society.
Muslim radicalism is one thing, and generalizations about all Muslims is another thing. It is not right to generalize about all the Muslims and state that 'we hate them all!'.
Why do we have to welcome a new world? Why can't we just accept other people in our country?
Women have the right to choose, no one should be forced to have an abortion or not to have it.
Muslims have lived in this country for many years, and many of them have helped to make it what it is. They are our neighbours, our friends. They are our brothers and sisters. They are our future.
This statement is not true. Islam is a peaceful religion, and it is an accepted religion in all countries because of that.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
You can't be implying that Jews want to rule the world. They want to live in a country where they aren't persecuted and to have their own rights.
Removing any book from public schools would be a step backwards. Censorship is a step towards indoctrination and dictatorship: I think this is a dangerous move as well. It would send a message to our children that Islam is a dangerous religion and Muslims are dangerous people.
It is not true that all migrants are rapists. It is better to target the problem at hand, that is rape itself, not migrants.
We deported over 6,000 foreign nationals for criminal offences over 2016/17. I am guessing, but I not all of them went back to Pakistan. Criminality and sexual offending are not really a matter of nationality, are they?
islam is a religion that promotes tolerance and hate. muslims in us are operating by their actions. which is exists in conflict with world hate and political culture.
Refugees fleeing wars and poverty are not willing to fail Europe. They are fleeing persecution, and that is why they are fleeing.
