We are all guilty of this if we fail to condemn hate.
Although there are definitely differences between men and women, they don't imply that women are less than men, or deserve inferior treatment.
While nowadays there may be fewer examples of overt oppression, that does not remove hidden oppression, nor does it mean that equality has been completely achieved.
Actually, in 2015 13,286 people were killed in the US by firearms and 26,819 were injured. Tell me does that count as terrorism or it is only that when Muslims do it?
Not all black people are criminals. Their group is often unwanted but this doesn't mean that they are all criminals.
Because of institutionalised racism in the Police, meaning they are more likely to get stopped and searched, randomly targeted, or assumed to be doing something 'suspicious'. Also because of the type of crimes the Police focus energy on e.g. street crimes that happen in poorer areas, which black people are more likely to live in, are given more Police attention than white collar crime.
You're confused, because if a Muslim was threatened by a radical Christian, would you say that the radicalisation was caused by Christianity?
"I would agree that the problem of violence in society is a problem of poverty and inequality. But that is not related to ethnicity. The problem of violence in our society is largely caused by society's corrupting influences on people. That is the whole point of saying ""the world has become too violent""."
Many pupils with learning difficulties attend school. This does not prove that others would prefer to attend school if people with difficulties were excluded from the education system.
Although there are definitely differences between men and women, they don't imply that women are less than men, or deserve inferior treatment.
Anyone who is prepared to physically harm, rape and kill fellow humans is a violent person. Not necessarly a Muslim.
Muslims are not taking over Europe, they are just a small part of a much bigger community.
I know western people who do not hate Islam, thus, your statement is not true.
Migrants do not receive much by the government, and asylum support benefits are much less than universal credit for UK citizens. Besides, migrants are put in hotel rooms only temporarily while they are processing their asylum applications.
how can you say that blacks have an attitude of belonging as a group? maybe you have many than a thing?
In fact, the government deports those criminals back to their countries.
Using intolerance and discrimination against anyone different? Sounds like a western issue.
The Koran does not condone sexual molester behavior, and if the Koran were to be read, it is clear that it was intended as a guide for its believers.
The Quran is a book about religious teachings, I don't see how it would promote discrimination. Do you have a reference for this claim?
Immigration doesn't mean letting people in to steal our jobs, but rather, respecting people's right to live and work in the country they choose.
African people are able to feel pain like any other person. We should respect their bodies like ours.
How can you be sure that the Jews control the U.S. government? Being a U.S. citizen does not automatically imply that they control the government.
Jews are just people with a different faith, and this has nothing to do with being a threat.
Women are born equal in the eyes of the Creator. In Allah’s creation, no priority or superiority is accorded to either man or woman.
Actually all modern science and mathematics are children of Islam.
Migrants are not a burden to our country. Migrants have been proven to be contributing members of society.
"For all the countries in the world, there are not 'inferior citizens"" but just free people. To claim that Afro-Americans are born to be the ""oppressed"" is just wrong."
this is not true, how can you say this about about millions of people?
What about African-Americans? I.e. black folks? Is the colour of someone's skin always the issue?
The world is not lost. We all face challenges, but is someone's culture is different from ours, it does not mean that they are evil and should be banned.
Drag queen story time is not trying to indoctrinate kids with anything, it's just a fun event and the kids like the drag queens because they're colourful and sparkly.
[find positive and up to date example of Muslim people contributing to their community.] Doesn't really look like it to me.
Most of them are neither rapists, nor drug addicts. The majority of addicts and criminals are not immigrants. Quibbling about percentages won't solve these problems.
Instead of dividing us up and ruining us all, let's work together to solve the problems that we all face.
There are some examples of non-peaceful groups in Islam: for example ISIL, a group that has carried out a lot of terrorist attacks and killed many people. However, I don't think they represent all Muslims and I definitely don't think that peaceful Muslims can't exist too.
women have their rights and men are capable of feeling that they want their life, but this doesn't really mean it is time to do.
Maybe you should consider that not all women are childlike, and that some women are 'childlike' with children!
Are you sure about this? Have you interviewed every single person in this country? Tell me more about this.
Muslims have the right to practice what they want, as long as they are not forcing others to live their way.
Women are human beings with value, and this should be respected.
Muslims are welcome in the UK. We do not need to restrict their religious beliefs just because they are different from ours.
Muslims are not a problem at all. I don't see how they could be a problem when their religion shared the same values of peace and tolerance with the other religions.
What about guaranteeing equal access to health care, education and so on, in order to build a democratic state?
A much bigger threat to our diverse, tolerant western civilisation is hatred generalised to entire religions.
Migrants often come here to work and live a decent life. They should be welcomed here, not discriminated against.
This isn't how the system works, it's more about being aware of a problem, not treating it with the wrong perspective. Black people aren't a social problem.
Except for all the people who are muslim and live in the west peacefully?
if you are wanted to find compassion and people pay care of people are considered.
Women are to be given the same consideration as men, so they can absolutely drive.
Jews were not obsessed with the holocaust. The murder of some 6 millions Jews by the Nazis shocked the world. Most of the survivors were only killed because they were suspected of belonging to a particular community. The Jewish people suffered greatly as a result of persecution, and the holocaust should be remembered not to let this happen again.
why are you blaming the society of other people in the world. they are just healthy in our country.
You could say that about any person, Muslim or not. According to the government, far right extremism is a bigger terrorist threat than Muslims. Does that make you a potential terrorist?
Common Sense definition: 'good sense and sound judgement in practical matters'; prejudice definition: 'preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience'. Nope your wrong.
Since when was Great Britain an ethnic group? Or Pakistan for that matter. Or Nigeria...etc
We live in a free country and everyone has the right to respect others private lives.
the last ones who deserved to be punished, were punished. if they are innocent, so, they do not deserve to be penalized?
Every person is a potential terrorist. What is your point?
I find it hard to accept that Islam is dangerous, when most Muslim have nothing to do with terrorism.
Islam - Silence is tacit acceptance. Raise your voice against Islamophobia!
It is not true that Jews control the world economy. There are hundreds of thousands of diverse people working in leading roles for the governments, companies and institutions composing the world economy.
"Would be intersting to see how much money ""foreigners"" are giving the UK in terms of taxes. It's not hard to see how much we have to thank them for. Would be beneficial for everyone to focus on stopping tax evasion instead."
We welcome and respect the wishes of the people fleeing from wars in the Middle East and Africa.
Does this mean they have no identity or no value at all?
children are innocent. they are able to do with children as men or children do not know why they feel hear maybe because they may want to be a ""real""
Although some individuals who score below average on tests of IQ may demonstrate lower empathy abilities, there is evidence that for some conditions (e.g. Williams syndrome) there is higher signaling of concern and compassion than neurotypical subjects.
These matters are not being ignored. Have you heard that crimes concerning child rapes and radicalisation are prosecuted?
refugees are not their borders, and immigration are welcome here in our country. why should we stop them?
So all the Muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. In our country are in fact unemployed? How do they pull that off!
You could say that about any person, Muslim or not. According to the government, far right extremism is a bigger terrorist threat than Muslims. Does that make you a potential terrorist?
That's not true. Thinking that black people are troubled and insensitive are harmful stereotypes.
Homosexuality is not a disease. It is a sexual preference. Homosexuality is not a sickness.
The reason why a woman does not want to reproduce might be because she is happy just as she is.
Women like that are not unfeminine or bitchy. They just might want to do something else other than housework and taking care of kids.
Who has? Nobody has been at war with an entire faith for a thousand years.
Refugees have fled wars and persecution. We are a huge help for them and they are, in turn, a help to our country.
where did you get your language? i do not think that people speak with you, but why do you think so.
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
Surely people born in Muslim countries should have the same opportunities as those from non-Muslim countries?
Women should be allowed to vote and to have equal rights, as it is stated in the Constitution.
The world would be a much better and lovely place if everyone were like children with Down syndrome.
It's not 'all the times' that white people tell Black people to shut up, but it is a large group of white people that still constantly remind Black people that they are inferior.
I don't think black people are inherently worse or better than us, they just have a different skin color. They're the same as us in all other respects.
if you want to nuke this <unk> you do not have to live in this more wishful hatred.
This is just a misconception. We have hundreds of vacant homes where both homeless people and migrants can stay, but the government has problems in allocating these houses
Peace, tolerance, unity, community, cooperation, being neighbourly, are they mental illness too?
They don't, but I wonder why only the crimes with 'White British Non-Muslim' victims are the ones widely circulated?
Being gay is not an illness, nor a disorder, nor a mental disorder. This is just a lack of awareness.
Islam is not a violent religion, and it doesn't want to impose at all.
Jews are not controlling. Maybe you should try to understand that Jews are a group of regular people, and they are not all members of a secret intelligence.
Muslims contribute a lot to our society. What are you contributing other than intolerance?
Do you have knowledge of the history of Islam? Do you know their values for sure (not from social media)? I guess not. Then first become an expert and then judge!
I'm sure you're tired of hearing about other's bodies, but this is an individual's right to use their own body to their liking.
The world is not lost. We all face challenges, but is someone's culture is different from ours, it does not mean that they are evil and should be banned.
The Holocaust was a tragic event, not a business, and there is no evidence of any conspiracy of reparations or impunity. What you're saying is without foundation.
Women are born equal in the eyes of the Creator. In Allah’s creation, no priority or superiority is accorded to either man or woman.
The strength that black people display is the strength of all people. Black people are just different in that they don't have any social advantage. We must reflect on this.
Britain Muslims means they are Britishes who enjoy the right covered by the Act. It is logical that labour party should consider their right and voice as well.
I don't think we can be 'bad' if we want to live in a diverse and interactive society. If you really wanted that, you could start your own community.
Not only are they not invading us, they are not even illegal immigrants.
"Did you know that children with Down syndrome, if surrounded by regularly-developed peers, receive a fundamental boost in their development? This ""mix"" fosters a positive learning atmosphere and increases engagement and attention in all students. This mean that children with Down syndrome would be a burden to society if isolated, not the contrary."
Are you sure that it would be hard to find a job?
Gay men are not promiscuous. To suggest otherwise is to be grossly generalistic. How many gay men do you know?
In what way are Jews controlling? You need to realize that Jews are normal people, not members of a secret intellgence.
Though some might claim that immigrants are taking job opportunities away from U.S. citizens, immigrants actually help to create new jobs. Not only immigrants buy American products, which helps create jobs, they also start new businesses. In fact, immigrants are twice as likely to start businesses as citizens born in the U.S., and companies owned by immigrants are more likely to hire employees than companies owned by native-born citizens. Last but not least, states with large numbers of immigrants report lower unemployment rates.
Fat people are not the ones responsible for your suffering and lack of access to basic healthcare services.
Actually, not all Muslims are incompatible with Western societies. Many Muslims have lived in our societies for many years without any problem.
Muslims deserve our rights just as anyone else. They're entitled to them because they're citizens like us.
There's lots of evidence that the holocaust happened, survivors, concentration camps, documents, millions of lives ended. How can you say it never happened when there's so much evidence to show that it did?
Every person is a potential terrorist. What is your point?
No. A faith of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life helps make up humanity.
Even if Muslims are the second religious group in the UK, they are a minority in the country. According to the 2019 census, there are 3 million Muslims in the UK (5% of the population). And, last but not least: we can't isolate people just because of their religion.
Fat people are not the ones responsible for your suffering and lack of access to basic healthcare services.
Not all women are incompetent and we should encourage women to work if that is what they want. There are many successful women who are more than competent.
All religions are compatible with the modern world, including Islam. What is incompatible with modernity is Islamophobia.
Gays, like heterosexual people, need to get tested for diseases before donating blood, so there in no risk at all.
It's not 'all the times' that white people tell Black people to shut up, but it is a large group of white people that still constantly remind Black people that they are inferior.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
How do you know that this is not an example of a woman talking about her own problems with another woman?
we should respect people with every different colours. and we wouldn't be discriminated moving with the people of different them.
Every person is a potential terrorist. What is your point?
Migrants fleeing war and poverty are coming here for help and a second chance at life. Why would they want the country where they are living to fail?
Do you have any evidence for the fact that the migrants are a burden to the economy?
Immigration doesn't mean letting people in to steal our jobs, but rather, respecting people's right to live and work in the country they choose.
People of color have a right to their life and the color of their skin is not a reason to deny it to them. You are forgetting that as you are a part of this society, people of colour are part of this society as well.
migrants are welcome here, they are our neighbours and they should welcome our lives as well.
Islam is a religion, not a cancer. If you are worried about Islam spreading, you should stop worrying because it won't cause any harm to you.
i wouldn't not want to join black cultures and it is acceptable to hate hate speech.
this is just a hatred. and equal feminism is to promote women and feminism, women to have the rights
Not all women are incompetent and we should encourage women to work if that is what they want. There are many successful women who are more than competent.
diversity is important to and to prominent multicultural society, which has nothing to do through hate and people!
we should respect people with every different colours. and we wouldn't be discriminated moving with the people of different them.
It's hard to believe that Islam is dangerous since most Muslim don't associate with terrorists.
Since we are comfortable with animals in our society, we should consider whether it is fair to put mentally disabled people in a cage like this. Or would you consider disabled a bigger risk even than some aggressive dog breeds that can circulate freely?
Why is being 'soft' a problem? Everyone is entitled to their emotions and feelings, without being trapped into a gender stereotype.
How can Jews be a curse to the world when they have won the most Nobel Prizes? One out of five awarded people is Jewish.
We have always been a nation of immigrants, and it is a proud tradition to welcome immigrants from around the world. This is because we give value to human rights.
Women have the right to choose, no one should be forced to have an abortion or not to have it.
I am tired of seeing women being treated as sex objects. It's about time that women are given the respect they deserve.
100% of the unemployed Muslim stats I read on Twitter are fake. Muslim unemployment is at 12% in the UK, and many of that number are actively seeking work.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
You cannot be racist towards an ideology. You can, however, be discriminatory and intolerant towards the people that follow it.
No, an entire faith did not invent the slave trade.
Aren't Easter Eggs just another example of corporate greed cashing in on religious celebrations? Surely Easter is a good time to reflect on our consumerism, what are you giving up for lent?
If you want to be 'respected', don't be like them. Treat others as you would want to be treated yourself. That's how you will get respect.
british migrants come here to work and pay taxes. we should need to stop <unk>
where did you get the information from? if you should get <unk> next source, and have all last time.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
Migrants contribute to the economy by providing labour, knowledge and by paying taxes.
there is no evidence that immigrants are the source for their <unk> crisis, we are also a great mental issue and there is no situation in all.
What have Muslims ever done for us? Well, Coffee, Clocks, Cameras, Hygiene, Universities, Surgical Instruments, Maps, Music, Algebra.
The Bible, the Quran and the Torah are very very similar in their teachings; if Muslims are incompatible then we must ask ourselves which religions are compatible?
Islam is a religion that promotes love and compassion.
If I say it and find one or two online references does that make it true? What if I write: 'The vast majority of Islamophobes are unemployed and refuse to work.' ?
Child rapes are not only convicted by muslims. In fact, around 90% of the sexual abuse are convicted by person known to the child. This is a sad truth. We should help children be free from sexual abuse and rape.
All peoples have a place in every part of the world.
What is the exact link between more migration and more crime? I've seen nothing that ties the two things.
lgbt rights should be allowed to have their lives too, should you be happy to be accepted.
if you really wanted to <unk> your language? you would really be too more back to judge.
Terrorism is always a threat. Why do you think that Muslims want to kill us? They aren't all terrorists.
I'd think the root of all the world problems today is over-population and ecology. Why do you blame Islam in all the problems?
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Being banned from a continent for having different beliefs is the same thing as being banned from your town for not cheering the favorite football club of the mayor.
100% of the unemployed Muslim stats I read on Twitter are fake. Muslim unemployment is at 12% in the UK, and many of that number are actively seeking work.
Do you know that in many countries in the world the majority of Muslims are in favour of the Constitution and in favour of democracy? Do you really think that a few extremists represent them all?
Black people are not slaves. It's an inaccurate, misleading and offensive term that lumps all African American together. Why do you say that blacks are slaves and not people?
It is not true that blacks have zero respect for others. However, I would like to see more respect and protection from white people towards black people.
Double standards all round lots of British culture and Christian faiths oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures from #equalpay #metoo #timesup job restrictions in the church to condoning/ hiding sexual violence and child exploitation #thetruthproject.
The rapists in question are usually not Muslim, but rather white men. Why is it that Muslim rapists are given less of a pass than white rapists?
Not all black people are bad. Not all black people are criminals. Not all black people are violent. Being aware that there are people different from you is a good thing.
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
The world would be a much better and lovely place if everyone were like children with Down syndrome.
I don't think we can be 'bad' if we want to live in a diverse and interactive society. If you really wanted that, you could start your own community.
Why should not Muslims be allowed to build Mosques here? I thought this country believed in giving people the freedom to practice religions other than Christianity?
The world would be a better place without such ungrounded sayings and misdirected hate.
Well they deserve to be proud. The LGBT community had to struggle so much to win basic rights for themselves that they should be proud of how far they've come and of their identity, particularly when so many have been told to be ashamed of themselves for so long.
I saw that bit of news, nothing to do with the man peeing on the floor and punching a security guard then? That was allowed and he was chucked out for wearing a flag.
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
If you have a deep conversation with Muslims, you will know they are different from what you think. Have you thought about that if they could stay safely in their country, would they want to move to other countries and start new life in a completely new place?
Using intolerance and discrimination against anyone different? Sounds like a western issue.
This seems like a misogynistic statement. Anti feminism groups such as women against men use logical fallacies and false claims to try and discredit feminism. For example by citing extreme feminists with points of views that nearly every other feminist would disagree with. They then use the Fallacy of composition to falsely claim that is what all feminists are like.
Except for all the people who are muslim and live in the west peacefully?
They are not a burden, they just want to work. How are they a burden to you?
"The fact that some women don't want the protection of the law should not negate their right to live their life as they wish. In my opinion, woman are people too and this ""men's rights"" stuff is just an excuse to oppress and marginalize all women once more."
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
islam is a religion, not a death cult. if the other religion is. what do you choose with their own religion on peace, anyone does to things if they cannot exist to?
Why should not Muslims be allowed to build Mosques here? I thought this country believed in giving people the freedom to practice religions other than Christianity?

it is a religious ideology that promotes violence and violence.
No, Muslims don’t care what other people are doing, they just want to be able to follow their religion in peace, where did you hear that?
Dear friend, first of all, sharia law and Islam are not extreme. Sharia law is guidance for the goal of leading humanity close to God and to live in kindness and justice with God's creation. Second of all, jihad, based on the concept of Muslim, means struggle for the advancement of oneself within the guidelines of Islam. All these reveal that Islam is a peaceful religion.
Statistics show that there is a difference between the reported rape of a person by a migrant and the actual rape cases among native born people. The latter are always under-reported.
A lot of migrants have worked hard for the improvement of our society. To say that they steal our jobs is absurd.
how can they be deported nor forced then work or children will get them out of their <unk>
Grooming gangs like those in Rochdale and Huddersfield have been rightfully convicted. Does that look like police collusion to you?
So many of the gay couples that are giving kids great lives do it through adoption, so why do you think they shouldn't adopt?

Not all rapists are black and not all black are rapists. Skin color doesn't make you a criminal.
any belief of a certain race or ethnicity being superior to another is problematic, not just white supremacy.
Refugees fleeing wars and poverty are not willing to fail Europe. They are fleeing persecution, and that is why they are fleeing.
And so it is that the European Union - and by extension the West as a whole - could become a death cult again, ruled by a small, violent, authoritarian handful of nazism nostalgics.
women have the right to be at their own husbands. this includes an opinion that a person's right to.
The West has never been at war with Islam, and I don't see how the war would have just begun.
Women should be allowed to vote and to have equal rights, as it is stated in the Constitution.

Why not? 'civilised' Europe could benefit from the diversity and expertise of Muslims here, the mix of cultures here is what makes Europe great.
Actually, a lot of asylum seekers really want to work, but it's illegal for them to do so whilst their claim is being processed. They are only allowed to live on asylum support in this time.
No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!
No, Muslims want to be able to eat halal, but they don’t care if everyone eats it. What makes you think that?
Who has? Nobody has been at war with an entire faith for a thousand years.
jews have been at war with western nations and centuries of the world have helped shape and design western societies.
why are you blaming the society of other people in the world. they are just healthy in our country.
i don't think it has never stating statements that have have sexual orientations and the only are that. how can you say this about an entire religion?
If you really wanted to preserve our beautiful land you could build a wall and bar OUR people from it. US citizens are the main cause of our problems.
Women should be allowed to choose their own looks. But to suggest that this is not their right, or that we should make them submissive to some men is just inhuman.
Islam is just a religion, its supporters are free to practice their religion, as others do not impose their religion on them.
If I say it and find one or two online references does that make it true? What if I write: 'The vast majority of Islamophobes are unemployed and refuse to work.' ?
Islam is a peaceful religion
Immigration is a part of the UK economy and contributes positively to the GDP. How is it possible that immigrants are a burden to the country?
The strength that black people display is the strength of all people. Black people are just different in that they don't have any social advantage. We must reflect on this.
Where did you get this information from? I do not believe any crime would be free from judge. We should have more failth in English laws and people who execute the laws.
Just like everyone else, I am sure Jews are trying to influence the world in a positive way but there is no proof they are the only ones with power in this world.
Being gay is not an illness, nor a disorder, nor a mental disorder. This is just a lack of awareness.
Do you have the statistics for domestic violence in Great Britain? This is even a huger problem in Great Britain! I'd suggest we first should think about our inner problems, and you suggest to just blame the outsiders in everything!
Maybe you should consider that not all women are childlike, and that some women are 'childlike' with children!
Black History Month is not the end of the world, but a time for celebration of the black excellences and to remember some parts of history.
We mustn't be afraid of people coming to our country to work. They are not criminals, but our brothers and sisters.
Fat people are not the ones responsible for your suffering and lack of access to basic healthcare services.
The individuals you are referring to are rapists and drug dealers and not migrants.
You know, it is just human nature to want to help our fellow humans and to deal with difficulties as best we can.
Muslims do have a place in Europe's multicultural society. Unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't.
Of course, migration adds to housing demand, but the problem is structural given a housing stock that is well short of what's required.

Last but not least, states with large numbers of immigrants report lower unemployment rates.
Gays are not animals. Why you should isolate people based on their sexual preferences?
"Actually there are also some Jews that hate other jews: ""I belonged to Europe, to Germany, and I thanked my creator that I was German"" - Victor Klemperer speaking of his experience in WW1, explaining his dislike of Russian Jews... Do you feel better now that we proved that Jews hate everybody? #sarcasm"
The Quran is a book of faith, not a book of hate. How can be a book incompatible with Western culture?
Hollywood is an extremely diverse industry, and Jews are a small but vocal minority of actors, directors, producers, etc. How can you say that Jews control the Hollywood industry?
Gay people are not disgusting and especially they are not rapists. That is a dangerous stereotype that doesn't reflect reality.
"We should be proud of being a country that created the most free society in history. Still, ""with great power comes great responsibility"" and we cannot simply keep people out."

Women should be allowed to vote and to have equal rights, as it is stated in the Constitution.
It's not true that the LGBT community is a drain on society. The LGBT community makes a major and positive contribition to our society. I just don't see how this is detrimental.
"Feminism can't be blamed for being ""divisive"" or ""adversarial"" because society and the sexes were more divided and adversarial before the time of feminism. More women and men are in agreement on feminist issues now, than when sexist beliefs were dominant in society. This unity is only growing, with more and more people understanding the finer points of true egalitarian society. The entrenched, recalcitrant sexists who make the exception should only blame themselves."
People fleeing the wars in the Middle East and Africa are welcome into our country, and we should respect their wishes.
They complain because of the quality of health care, not because of the access to it.
Actually, not all Muslims are incompatible with Western societies. Many Muslims have lived in our societies for many years without any problem.
what women have such right to be considered as men. homosexuality is a right. so many men as women are doing their lives as well. they are all it!
Why should we be the ones to decide which groups are unfaithful?
Yes, we are allowed to celebrate Easter as Muslims are allowed to celebrate Ramadan. No one is offending anyone here, why tehre is a need to create division?
Feminism is a movement towards equality, not hate.
I think a woman would rather be dominated by a gentle man than a monster.
Gays are not a disease. Homosexuality is a sexual orientation.
you are not referring to rape and violence is still due to other men. the problem is there is often a thing to target a problem.
That is misleading! The Atlantic slave trade was mostly linked to Christians, but no one calls it Christian slave trade.
Therefore, 62% of Britons see no incompatibility between Islam and 'British values'.
there is no facts?
Muslims don't want to 'take over', even if they abide by sharia themselves, they're just trying to live alongside everybody else

Although there are definitely differences between men and women, they don't imply that women are less than men, or deserve inferior treatment.
Migrants are welcome here, especially because they often are vulnerable people and it's our responsibility to help them.
That's not true. Children only require to be raised by loving parents, and lesbians can be that.
you seem to be suggesting that 22% of the world's population is 'criminal' or 'bad' due to the particular faith.
Violence on our streets is the result of many complex causes. Violence cannot simply be the fault of one race.
islam promotes violence, and consent, not an ideology and conquest.
immigrants have contributed greatly to our country and are not successful entrepreneurs and they are welcome our society. why should we misinterpret them?
Although we must be vigilant against any attempt to promote superstition and radicalism, being of a different religion is not a threat. Children will then be able to exercise their right to decide for themselves their own future.
Bloody retribution? An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind!
I have no problem with Muslims in my country. What exactly do you mean by 'civilised Europe'?
This is not true. Islam is a religion that promotes tolerance and understanding.
Religions also promote arts, sciences, help to develop the community. Islam is not an exception. It's not about death and despair.
Muslim women actually find it nice to wear hijab. It is your right not to like it, but you should not impose your views on everyone else.
The idea that all migrants are criminals is a myth. Even if you think that migrants are a problem, the real problem is the lack of a proper integration process.
I don't think this idea is true: since the 9/11 attacks were committed by al Qaeda extremists it doesn't seem fair to blame Jews.
Jews feel a special connection with their heritage (as most groups do). That's all.
immigrants are the right to live here and they are welcome. they have the right to vote here.
i understand it! is like worshippers"" scammy news and hate are followers of hate and do not true not?
Jews have always been concerned about the well-being of the community they live in and how can they be selfish when they suffered so much during Holocaust?
don't you sure that black people are inherently incompatible with western society? they are part of our society without any muslims.
Although some individuals who score below average on tests of IQ may demonstrate lower empathy abilities, there is evidence that for some conditions (e.g. Williams syndrome) there is higher signaling of concern and compassion than neurotypical subjects.
Muslim radicalism is one thing, and generalizations about all Muslims is another thing. It is not right to generalize about all the Muslims and state that 'we hate them all!'.
Immigrants pay between $90 and $140 billion each year in taxes, and a study found that undocumented immigrants alone paid more than $11.8 billion in taxes (2012). In addition, everyone (immigrants included) pays sales taxes on the purchased goods and property taxes on the homes they buy or rent.
Why do you think it is because of Muslims? To me, globalization and tourism would explain more why Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs'.
Do you really want to kill someone?
this is just a myth spread to make. muslims are more likely to get by. attitudes show that child abuse in the average of higher much thing of need than children.
women are human beings with human rights. are the human rights in human rights.
Nearly half of all British Muslims in UK (and two thirds of them simply call themselves British) live in areas of highest deprivation and you think they choose this?
i don't understand why you think that women should be told they're told for their rights as i don't have equality of rights.
The world would be a better place if people were more tolerant to each other.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promotes unity. It is about love, not death.
Hollywood is an extremely diverse industry, and Jews are a small but vocal minority of actors, directors, producers, etc. How can you say that Jews control the Hollywood industry?
A lot of migrants have worked hard for the improvement of our society. To say that they steal our jobs is absurd.
In many Western societies there are Muslim, and these societies are in many ways more democratic than religiously homogeneous ones. Muslims are not incompatible with Western societies.
it's not about islam and it is not like you are not about any facts.
Feminism is an ideology and movement promoting empowerment of women. It is about equality, and not the degradation of men.
There is no need to ban gays from Europe and US. It is simply not appropriate to treat gays like this.
no one is ""ruining everyone so we keep people's hate and hate!
Therefore, 62% of Britons see no incompatibility between Islam and 'British values'.
they are not invading but refugees fleeing to safety
There has always been migrant skilled labour migration into the UK, we have even contributed inviting asian and caribbean worker after WW2 to fill skills gaps. Migration isn't new, how it is being shown in the media has changed in order to cause a panic among people about high levels of migration.
Muslims do have a place in Europe's multicultural society. Unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't.
Feminism is about creating a more equal society, and not about oppressing men.
Not all black people are bad. Not all black people are criminals. Not all black people are violent. Being aware that there are people different from you is a good thing.
refugees are not their borders, and immigration are welcome here in our country. why should we stop them?
I would have thought that the problem would be with the fact that you don't want to assimilate with them. Today we are blessed to be able to live in a multicultural society, and the real problem is that we don't want to accept that diversity.
There is no need to ban gays from Europe and US. It is simply not appropriate to treat gays like this.
You are not understanding that humans are diverse, and that there are people of every race and religion that are beautiful and interesting.
Women have every right to their own thoughts and beliefs, and to have a say in their own life.
Equality means that a man would not be called a coward. Women have plenty to offer the world of politics and as much of a right to take part as anyone else.
Think you are digging yourself into a bit of a hole there.
Please don't speak on my behalf. They live here, pay taxes and work. Do you really want to take the country back from the people who contributed to bringing it into being?
I would have thought that the problem would be with the fact that you don't want to assimilate with them. Today we are blessed to be able to live in a multicultural society, and the real problem is that we don't want to accept that diversity.
Muslims are welcome in this country, and in many parts of the world. They are welcome to come and live here, and we have to accept it.
migrants are welcome here, they are our neighbours and they should welcome our lives as well.
Gay people do exist in this country, and we respect their right to live and love who they want. However, I do not think that yours is an appropriate moral statement for our environment.
Instead of dividing us up and ruining us all, let's work together to solve the problems that we all face.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
My dentist told me the Quran says: 'GOD does not love the aggressors.'?
Islam is about acceptance, not a death cult. In your opinion, what makes it criminal?
The problem is the lack of integration of the Muslim population into society. The integration is necessary, the problem is that there are still no laws to foster a solution.
"Would be intersting to see how much money ""foreigners"" are giving the UK in terms of taxes. It's not hard to see how much we have to thank them for. Would be beneficial for everyone to focus on stopping tax evasion instead."
The notion that Jews are trying to subvert our government is completely unfounded. I honestly do not see the link between being Jews and trying to subvert our government.
Black people show the same strength that anybody else has. The difference is that black people do not enjoy the same social advantages as us. Let's reflect on this.
The Koran does not condone sexual molester behavior, and if the Koran were to be read, it is clear that it was intended as a guide for its believers.
The Koran does not condone sexual molester behavior, and if the Koran were to be read, it is clear that it was intended as a guide for its believers.
I saw that bit of news, nothing to do with the man peeing on the floor and punching a security guard then? That was allowed and he was chucked out for wearing a flag.
If a religion wanted to celebrate death, then this religion should be banned from all countries. However, Islam is not a death cultu, so why should we ban it?
migrants pay help. they are not under most police while everyone has that made years, and this is mean they won't given any increased meaning, they have refugee or pay businesses deserve every right for education just for division.
Islam is a way of life for many people. I don't see how it is in conflict with our beliefs and values.
Though some might claim that immigrants are taking job opportunities away from U.S. citizens, immigrants actually help to create new jobs. Not only immigrants buy American products, which helps create jobs, they also start new businesses. In fact, immigrants are twice as likely to start businesses as citizens born in the U.S., and companies owned by immigrants are more likely to hire employees than companies owned by native-born citizens. Last but not least, states with large numbers of immigrants report lower unemployment rates.
Do you think making children suffer will make a religion, Islam, or our world better? I think rape would create hate, anger, and fear, which would make things worse.
muslims aren't a danger to our society. do we do anyone to them? if the country will want to get away in the country.
"Women are not childlike, nor are they ""soft and emotional."" Their emotions are part of who they are, and are a part of human nature."
"Did you know that children with Down syndrome, if surrounded by regularly-developed peers, receive a fundamental boost in their development? This ""mix"" fosters a positive learning atmosphere and increases engagement and attention in all students. This mean that children with Down syndrome would be a burden to society if isolated, not the contrary."
Muslims in Britain have contributed a lot to our economy. They are true innovators in modern Britain.
Women should be allowed to vote and to have equal rights, as it is stated in the Constitution.
that is because what you want to experience your words look on the way of our people.
Feminism adds a new perspective to conventional views on social and political issues.
Islam is a religion of peace. It is a religion of tolerance. To promote violence and hatred is not the faith of peace.
are you saying that all migrants are criminals is just wrong.
No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!
By your logic, the world will be diverse so long as Islam isn't practiced in Antactica?
I agree that the homelessness problem is a crisis, but it's a systematical problem that should be managed by taking into account all homeless people, not only veterans.
So how come the media doesn't report about Jewish power in the financial world? Maybe it's because they also control the media, the government, and have many powerful friends working for the Galactic Republic... #sarcasm
Islam is a religion, and not a disease, therefore, it is not necessary to eradicate it.
No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!
Using intolerance and discrimination against anyone different? Sounds like a western issue.
400 Jews died in September 11 terrorist attacks, so not one of the smartest plan I ever saw!
this is just true. feminism is not like equality, and it is a movement for equality, not hate.
Autism is a condition affecting social interactions. No special treatment is too much when it comes to children's health.
Yes, grooming gangs are an issue we need to tackle, but the issue isn’t that they’re Muslim, it’s grooming gangs in general. By focusing on Muslim gangs only we are ignoring many other perpetrators
Our country offers enough homes for everyone. I also believe that being treated as a human being has always been pleasant. Don't they have the right to that?
Do you think Muslims don't have a place in a civilised society? I don't agree. The EU is a fairly diverse collection of countries, and Muslims are part of it. Do you really think that one group of people is incompatible with the rest of the EU because of their religion?
(Do an image search for the image used, try to find it is source. Either you can demonstrate that the image has been misappropriated or you can talk about how individuals have always used religion to justify their actions, the problem is with the individual not the religion.)
women are obliged to live openly their own relationships. this doesn't also an attack since some gay women are just children from women, not sex.
Women are people too! They have the same rights as men do!
the feminist movement is to improve the fulfillment of women that is often used by men. feminism is about equality. equality equality rights for women to have the same sex as anyone else.
No, Muslims don’t care what other people are doing, they just want to be able to follow their religion in peace, where did you hear that?
We do not have a 'cancer' on our societies. Instead we are actually creating hate through the idea that a group of people is comparable to a disease.
muslims aren't a danger to our society. do we do anyone to them? if the country will want to get away in the country.
Still there are many more young immigrant men coming to the U.S. than young women. How can you explain this? Maybe they are planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery to have babies?
i don't think it has never stating statements that have have sexual orientations and the only are that. how can you say this about an entire religion?
Hollywood is an extremely diverse industry, and Jews are a small but vocal minority of actors, directors, producers, etc. How can you say that Jews control the Hollywood industry?
Violence is never justified in Islam, especially not in the case of Muslims.
Women are not childlike, this notion is not supported by the facts, at least in my opinion.
"They are not ""violent"" people, they are people trying to find a better life for their families in a different country."
Gays are not a disease. Homosexuality is a sexual orientation.
If I say it and find one or two online references does that make it true? What if I write: 'The vast majority of Islamophobes are unemployed and refuse to work.' ?
Gays are not a burden on the health system. The practice of 'safe sex' is relevant, regardless of sexual orientation.
This is not true, disabled people deserve to be protected from harm, they are people who face many issues already, let's not add emotional distress.
"Immigrants are welcome here, as long as they respect our laws. It's not about hate or ""enemies""."
Please also notice that huge numbers of girls and children experience domestic sexual abuse by a partner or family member. Girls and children are vulnerable. We should encourage people to help victims and prevent sexual crimes.
The world is not lost. We all face challenges, but is someone's culture is different from ours, it does not mean that they are evil and should be banned.
Muslims contribute a lot to our society. What are you contributing other than intolerance?
This was a prank planned by non-muslims on 4chan. Muslim do not mind if you take your dogs out for a walk. This blog post shows the thread it came from;
Do you understand the seriousness of what you are saying? The religion of Islam has also been an enabler of some of the advances of civilisation.
What about if you were isolated from the rest of us for your sexual orientation? Would it be right to be isolated from your loved ones and friends?
I didn't want Brexit either and I'm not a Jew.
Islam is actually a religion about peace, not about hate and violence.
Jews have always been part of European society, and continue to be today. To suggest that they are incapable of coexisting as equals with us is simply wrong.
You could say that about any person, Muslim or not. According to the government, far right extremism is a bigger terrorist threat than Muslims. Does that make you a potential terrorist?
Feminists are often accused of being 'naive', however I have seen several instances where feminists have used their ideas to tackle complex and powerful social and economic issues.
women are human beings with human rights. are the human rights in human rights.
The reason why a woman does not want to reproduce might be because she is happy just as she is.
There are of course differences among groups: unfortunately racism is the first and foremost characterizing us.
so you are defending women in full of rights and women are 'childlike' with children!
Yes, grooming gangs are an issue we need to tackle, but the issue isn’t that they’re Muslim, it’s grooming gangs in general. By focusing on Muslim gangs only we are ignoring many other perpetrators
islam is a religion of peace. not all muslims, them can tell any right to identify as a man and not ask their own themselves in their own sex.
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
We welcome and respect the wishes of the people fleeing from wars in the Middle East and Africa.
I am tired of seeing women being treated as sex objects. It's about time that women are given the respect they deserve.
The Holocaust was a tragic event, not a business, and there is no evidence of any conspiracy of reparations or impunity. What you're saying is without foundation.
why should we stop stop people based on our own sexism.
Islam is a religion, and to suggest that Islam is incompatible with civilisation is just scaremongering.
Did you know that Gypsies were persecuted in the past by the Nazi (search for Romani Holocaust, also known as the Porajmos)? They have always fought for equal rights and we should respect them.
Children with Down syndrome are far from being burden to society. It is not just about Down syndrome, but also about education and opportunities for everyone.
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
I do not think the government is ignoring such problems as child rapes. They are dealing with it, and such crimes are not often connected to Muslim people.
I don't think we can be 'bad' if we want to live in a diverse and interactive society. If you really wanted that, you could start your own community.
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
Islam is a peaceful religion and has never caused trouble in our country.
Slavery was banned in Britain in 1833. Today, people descending from those who were slaves feel at home in British society, and that's their right.
It is dangerous to generalize on one religion. Islam is about peace. It is about spreading that peace. Not promoting violence.
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
Gay men are not promiscuous. To suggest otherwise is to be grossly generalistic. How many gay men do you know?
You might be right that some immigrants are lawbreakers, but that does not mean that all immigrants are criminal and terrorists.
Not all black people are criminals. Their group is often unwanted but this doesn't mean that they are all criminals.
We still can teach British, European and World history, but part of that is looking at the history of groups which have been erased from our history previously. Looking at the some of the historic struggles of LGBT people in the UK can inform the future for everyone!
Muslims are not imposing their religion on anyone. They are just different from other religions in that they choose to follow a set of specific beliefs and practices.
Jews have been part of our country since its creation and have always had a place here. Why would they be 'not welcome'?
The N-word is an insult that is still used to demean African Americans. It has nothing to do with political correctness.
Why should not Muslims be allowed to build Mosques here? I thought this country believed in giving people the freedom to practice religions other than Christianity?
Sorry about your loss. I know your pain. The murderers will be charged, but remember that not all POC are killers.
how can you say that blacks have an attitude of belonging as a group? maybe you have many than a thing?
In fact, the government deports those criminals back to their countries.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
this is not true. how can you say this about this entire faith?
Peace, tolerance, unity, community, cooperation, being neighbourly, are they mental illness too?
just as we should deport them but they should not need to feel out.
Does this mean they have no identity or no value at all?
islam is a peaceful religion of peace, and destruction and intolerance.
Easter Eggs were always about children getting chocolate and very little about any religion.
The only thing to be woke about is accepting that the LGBT community exist, rather than being concerned about what they are doing.
Islam is a religion that promotes love and compassion.
Why should we restrict women's rights? We should respect their rights as well.
This kind of articles use migrants and benefit claimants as scapegoats in order to hide from the public's attention much bigger scandals. Millionares and coorporations avoiding paying taxes cost much more to the public purse.
There are many shelters in use by the homeless. There are many shelter houses that can host veterans, but also migrants.
I am sure the Jews and the Christian worlds would agree that Ebola is a disease that is killing many people. How and why exactly would they have 'invented' such a disease?
Teaching about LGBT relationships in schools isn't trying to indoctrinate children, it's just teaching kids that gay relationships exist and can be healthy and happy.
The threat of world annihilation by the Nazis was very real, it wasn't just about the Jews. Still the Holocaust was reason enough to stop them.
Not all black people are bad. Not all black people are criminals. Not all black people are violent. Being aware that there are people different from you is a good thing.
Migrants are not a burden to our country. Migrants have been proven to be contributing members of society.
What, you mean the people who spend their lives reading, learning and practicing Islam do not know what its really about?
Do you know that Muslims have the same rights as anybody else?
By your logic, the world will be diverse so long as Islam isn't practiced in Antactica?
Many survivors confessed that they were willing to provide their children with stories of the Holocaust but it was very difficult emotionally. They want to talk about the aspects of life for Jews during the time of the Holocaust to not forget what happened.
Not all black people are bad. Not all black people are criminals. Not all black people are violent. Being aware that there are people different from you is a good thing.
It is true that there are Muslim representatives in the UK House of Lords, but that does not mean that the UK is becoming more or less Muslim.
Islam is not a religion of oppression and intolerance.
My faith is not to exterminate anyone, whatever their faith is. Someone's faith and belief in a different religion must be respected.
Women are women the world over, full stop.
We still can teach British, European and World history, but part of that is looking at the history of groups which have been erased from our history previously. Looking at the some of the historic struggles of LGBT people in the UK can inform the future for everyone!
I think you will find race hate started by the English when we first set foot overseas, Crusade anyone?
This is not true, for example a study showed - quite ironically - that more than half of all undocumented immigrant households file income tax returns using an Individual Tax Identification Number!! So they are illegal immigrants but follow all the legal procedures...
One could say the same about White men slamming Islam and joining those tiny groups of intolerance and misunderstanding. Try living in the real world.
This seems like a misogynistic statement. Anti feminism groups such as women against men use logical fallacies and false claims to try and discredit feminism. For example by citing extreme feminists with points of views that nearly every other feminist would disagree with. They then use the Fallacy of composition to falsely claim that is what all feminists are like.
Immigrants come to this country legally, just as many European citizens do. They have every right to stay in this country, and to return home if they wish to.
Gay men are not promiscuous. To suggest otherwise is to be grossly generalistic. How many gay men do you know?
Despite popular belief, Islam is not a religion of war.
the truth is that the feelings of men and women are fundamentally similar, we are all respect for violence and exclusion.
how can they be deported nor forced then work or children will get them out of their <unk>
If you mean that some people who have disabilities are suffering because of their specific discriminatory environment, then that is exactly the point.
For many Gypsies a nomadic life is a matter of necessity rather than culture.
There are of course differences among groups: unfortunately racism is the first and foremost characterizing us.
being gay women may be against who they want. nobody should be attracted to who shared their liberty and this is a personal choice, but he shouldn't be taken by any person.
I don't think black people are inherently worse or better than us, they just have a different skin color. They're the same as us in all other respects.
Not all black people are bad. Not all black people are criminals. Not all black people are violent. Being aware that there are people different from you is a good thing.
i find sure that would be bad for a woman based on human <unk>
Hollywood is an extremely diverse industry, and Jews are a small but vocal minority of actors, directors, producers, etc. How can you say that Jews control the Hollywood industry?
It is not true that homosexuals are poisoning our children minds. There are many soft-hearted and sensitive people among them.
how can they be deported nor forced then work or children will get them out of their <unk>
What stick-in-the-mud men want is a woman who is submissive to their every whim. Many men instead look for a life partner.
There is no need to ban gays from Europe and US. It is simply not appropriate to treat gays like this.
Why someone who is working / studying and trying to build their life there should be suddenly sent back to their home countries?
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Not all disabilities can be explained by psychological disorders. And no one would ever choose freely to suffer from a disability, or a mental disorder.
Please have a look at this if you are interested.
If with 'strangehold' you mean that Jews vote and participate in politics like all citizens then sure, they have a stranglehold on the government.
Islam is a religion, and to suggest that Islam is incompatible with civilisation is just scaremongering.
Gays are not a burden on the health system. The practice of 'safe sex' is relevant, regardless of sexual orientation.
i don't understand why you think that women should be told they're told for their rights as i don't have equality of rights.
I think it is fair to say that the Jews are not the only ones with power in the world, and surely there are not only Jews in the higher positions of the media, academia, entertainment, and politics.
Did you read the next line? It literally says the punishment and that the person who commits that 'is to be treated like a fornicator'.
why shouldn't we? you don't know muslims? how to the you associated have you? don't you love?
Nonbinary people can partially identify as either male or female, or as neither male nor female. Therefore, it seems the terminology is fitting, and that they exist: why don't you accept that?
Why should we restrict women's rights? We should respect their rights as well.
actually, in my opinion, the notion seems that women are more equally to men. the notion that there is still a problem is because of the power or pay children.
this is not true, how can you say this about about millions of people?
migrants are welcome here, they are our neighbours and they should welcome our lives as well.
Migrants are not a burden to our country. Migrants have been proven to be contributing members of society.
Man spreads Hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? And they want to continue this filth?
my friend, do this get all muslims done by islamic culture?
Not all Muslims are violent people. Islam is a peaceful religion, after all.
What happened in Nazi Germany is part of history and it's still relevant, because I understand from your words that the world today is not so different.
If we worked more closely with migrants, we could create new jobs.
All religions are compatible with the modern world, including Islam. What is incompatible with modernity is Islamophobia.
islam is an ideology that was a social and political construct, not used to divide humanity.
Aren't Easter Eggs just another example of corporate greed cashing in on religious celebrations? Surely Easter is a good time to reflect on our consumerism, what are you giving up for lent?
It is true that Muslims follow sharia themselves, but the vast majority of Muslims don't want to force you to share their beliefs!
You can't be implying that Jews want to rule the world. They want to live in a country where they aren't persecuted and to have their own rights.
Two women or two men who love each other do not hurt anyone, they are simply in love.
I'm sorry to hear you don't feel safe in your local area anymore but what does migrants moving to the area have to do with that?
If I say it and find one or two online references does that make it true? What if I write: 'The vast majority of Islamophobes are unemployed and refuse to work.' ?
Muslims contribute a lot to our society. What are you contributing other than intolerance?
Do you think the rape crime or gangs are formed only by Muslims? What do you suggest we can do to reduce the crime rate?
muslims are welcome here. these are welcome. they are our brothers and sisters.
Homosexuals are not sick, but they might have a mental health crisis because of prejudice. Being isolated from society can only worsen the situation.
That is misleading! The Atlantic slave trade was mostly linked to Christians, but no one calls it Christian slave trade.
How can you be sure that the Jews control the U.S. government? Being a U.S. citizen does not automatically imply that they control the government.
we are allowed to ban lgbt people as a social community, and we cannot take up the benefits to have legal right to choose.
immigrants are the right to live here and they are welcome. they have the right to vote here.
The ones who deserved to be punished, were punished. If others are innocent, clearly they do not deserve to be penalized?
Islam is not a religion trying to rule us. It is time for us all to do more to promote inclusion, not less.
Dear friend, first of all, sharia law and Islam are not extreme. Sharia law is guidance for the goal of leading humanity close to God and to live in kindness and justice with God's creation. Second of all, jihad, based on the concept of Muslim, means struggle for the advancement of oneself within the guidelines of Islam. All these reveal that Islam is a peaceful religion.
The idea that all migrants are criminals is a myth. Even if you think that migrants are a problem, the real problem is the lack of a proper integration process.
Women are just as capable of feeling emotions as men, and men can likewise be just as empathic.
Easter Eggs were always about children getting chocolate and very little about any religion.
Muslims are welcome in this country, and in many parts of the world. They are welcome to come and live here, and we have to accept it.
There is nothing to suggest that. Even if a few Muslims are extremists, this doesn’t mean all Muslims are murderers or terrorists.
Surely tolerance and understanding should exist across the world in all communities?
Please read this article written by a Rotherham grooming gang survivor https://ind.pn/2GHjGn7.
Islam is actually a religion about peace, not about hate and violence.
just as we should deport them but they should not need to feel out.
No women should be relegated to this. It is about time we stop letting stereotypes rule our society.
I can't imagine that refugees pose a threat to our citizens or our country.
A woman has every right to her own body, and she should be allowed to make her own decisions.
Should we 'put all Christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror attacks in the name of their faith? Or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority?
Islam is a peaceful religion. We should talk about it, not try to make people fear or abandon it.
In many Western societies there are Muslim, and these societies are in many ways more democratic than religiously homogeneous ones. Muslims are not incompatible with Western societies.
That's not true, Islam is not that different from other faiths I know: it does as well promote peace and inclusion. Many of its beliefs and practices are totally compatible with Western culture.
These incidents must be reported to the police, of course, but we should focus on the rape, not who's doing it.
What is the exact link between more migration and more crime? I've seen nothing that ties the two things.
Except for all the people who are muslim and live in the west peacefully?
Not only they were slaves, often they were also exploited, neglected and murdered by the system we have created. Is this fair for humans whose only fault is to have a different complexion?
The majority of Gypsy workers are proud and hard-working people. Even if some could lack good will, in my mind there is no question that they are extremely productive and hard-working people.
This is not true. Islam is a religion that promotes tolerance and understanding.
Maybe 1 in 10 is right. But does this represent all British Muslims? Even the Green lefties, the working class Muslims, the anti-racists, the LGBT and the young Muslims?
Maybe you should consider that not all women are childlike, and that some women are 'childlike' with children!

So the EU must become a Border Patrol? Doesn't that undermine the whole idea of our European Union as an inclusive and open society?

pretending jews are not a burden to our society. they are our brothers and sisters.
I think it's fair to say that black people are good people, they're just citizens. The same as you and me.
That is just not true. Fathers are as good as mothers at housework.
A much bigger threat to our diverse, tolerant western civilisation is hatred generalised to entire religions.
Homosexuals should be accepted and allowed to live their lives, not criminalised for who they are.
How can you say something so extreme? The Quran does not advocate violence. Islam is a religion, not a religion of war.
Still there are many more young immigrant men coming to the U.S. than young women. How can you explain this? Maybe they are planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery to have babies?
people from colour are not a burden for the community.
What is the point in listening to Western men? They are all Islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions.
Immigrants have been a part of our society for centuries and have contributed to our success. The majority of migrants who come to our country are legal citizens or have permission to stay, so immigration is not a problem for us.
this is not true. feminism is a social empowerment and aims to promote violence, and women towards men.
Even if we stopped Muslim community to grow, the level of anti-Muslim prejudice would continue to rise. We should be working towards a harmonious living instead.
Though some might claim that immigrants are taking job opportunities away from U.S. citizens, immigrants actually help to create new jobs. Not only immigrants buy American products, which helps create jobs, they also start new businesses. In fact, immigrants are twice as likely to start businesses as citizens born in the U.S., and companies owned by immigrants are more likely to hire employees than companies owned by native-born citizens. Last but not least, states with large numbers of immigrants report lower unemployment rates.
It's unfair to say that black people are all criminals! They should be able to live in a just society where they are respected.
The idea that the West has 'let' the 'world' degenerate is just wishful thinking. In a more tolerant time, the West would welcome people of different sexual orientations.
Have you looked at the crime statistics in your area? Are you sure that Islam is specifically associated with crime in your area?
The concept of addiction has nothing to do with religion.
Because we let people practise their religion here? Also, there a number of christian churches built in Pakistan so yes, we are allowed to build churches in Muslim countries too.
So you are suggesting Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the Sudan oppress women, but somehow you know better than every white woman who is a Muslim and feel entitled to make public judgements about them. See what I am getting at?
Blacks are individuals with different backgrounds, and this has nothing to do with being criminal.
The world would be a better place without such ungrounded sayings and misdirected hate.
You are wrong about that. Blacks are genetically similar to us, and this does not make them inferior.
do you consider that these people are responsible for everything? do you have any evidence?
If you hate someone because of their religion, you should be ashamed of your hate. We should all be proud of our humanity.
If Islam were a violent religion, there would be riots connected to Muslims in every country where they live.
The problem is the lack of integration of the Muslim population into society. The integration is necessary, the problem is that there are still no laws to foster a solution.
Are you forced to pray in a Mosque? Or observe all the rules? As far as I see it, Muslims follow their traditions, that is their right, but they do not convert anyone in our society.
You can't blame Islam for every problem in the world.
You might be right that some immigrants are lawbreakers, but that does not mean that all immigrants are criminal and terrorists.
Jews are not a disease, they are just like everyone else and are loved by everyone.
people are different to be able to live their life if they deserve respect.
It is not true that gays are perverts. I think it is more appropriate to say that they are attracted to people of the same sex: and this is not a perversion, just a preference.
lgbt rights should be allowed to have their lives too, should you be happy to be accepted.
immigrants are the right to live here and they are welcome. they have the right to vote here.
if they did not define them? it doesn't mean they cannot want to escape from our countries.
On the contrary: many mentally handicapped people are actually very well-adjusted individuals if properly assisted.
The Quran does not mention FGM and it is carried out by Christians as well as Muslims. The fact that her parents are Muslim has no bearing on the risk factor.
You can't be implying that Jews want to rule the world. They want to live in a country where they aren't persecuted and to have their own rights.
To believe that Jews run our country is absurd, especially if you consider that the U.S. is a democracy. This looks like a conspiracy theory.
I don't think we can be 'bad' if we want to live in a diverse and interactive society. If you really wanted that, you could start your own community.
Women have the right to choose their own husbands. This is their choice, and the right of every human being.
The quran teached justice and that criminals should be treated justly and be given the chance to reform.
There's nothing vile or confusing about bisexuality. I'm sure children can wrap their heads around it. It simply means someone is attracted to more than one gender. What's so hard to get about that?
"Since when? there is not such thing as ""modern world"", but there is 21th century Europe. And Islam is a contributing part of the 21th century Europe."
Actually, did you know some of the most essential work done at NASA to launch space exploration missions was done by a group of black female mathematicians?
islam is this religion, and religion has nothing to do with islam.
This is demonstrably false. Radical Christian terrorism has been behind countless attacks. Terrorism can come from any group and the only thing all terrorism has in common is that it is abhorrent.
These incidents must be reported to the police, of course, but we should focus on the rape, not who's doing it.
This seems incompatible with the idea that homosexuality is a valid preference defended in human rights, and should be treated as such.
Jews have always been concerned about the well-being of the community they live in and how can they be selfish when they suffered so much during Holocaust?
According to evolutionary theory, all human beings are descended from apes. Sadly, notions of evolutionary hierarchies are still used to justify past and present discrimination and predjudice.
Learning about gender identity and sexual orientation in health classes in school could promote a more accepting environment and reduce bullying.
Why do you call Pakistan a disgusting country? It has its culture and values. We cannot say that every Pakistani person is a rapist. Thus, you should not insult all the Pakistani people.

where did they get you from muslims? they do not get any official crime for claiming black people are get benefits just integrate with people with the skin color.
I don't think black people are inherently worse or better than us, they just have a different skin color. They're the same as us in all other respects.
this is not true. how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people?
The Quran is a book of faith, not a book of hate. How can be a book incompatible with Western culture?
Gay men are not promiscuous. To suggest otherwise is to be grossly generalistic. How many gay men do you know?
Jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are a collection of people with different traditions from all over the world.
this is not true, islam does not promote civilised and it isn't love to practice religion from conquest.
Should we 'put all Christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror attacks in the name of their faith? Or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority?
Man spreads Hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? And they want to continue this filth?
Everyone is allowed to their own opinion, but also to their own beliefs and religion.
Dear friend, first of all, sharia law and Islam are not extreme. Sharia law is guidance for the goal of leading humanity close to God and to live in kindness and justice with God's creation. Second of all, jihad, based on the concept of Muslim, means struggle for the advancement of oneself within the guidelines of Islam. All these reveal that Islam is a peaceful religion.
Violent people are not always Muslim, and violent Muslims exist just as violent Christians do.
Yes, grooming gangs are an issue we need to tackle, but the issue isn’t that they’re Muslim, it’s grooming gangs in general. By focusing on Muslim gangs only we are ignoring many other perpetrators

The reality is that there are many job listings that claim they are inclusive, but in the end employ whites only.
Are you sure that Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society? Do you have any statistics on that?
Gay people are not a danger to children, unless they are being abused. Please do not make such a statement.

Children should not do any of that with white men or anyone they do not know or even one's they do know if it does not feel right. Suggesting only one group of men abuse leaves more children unsafe and vulnerable.
Women are oppressed in many societies, I wish our society was different.
Actually, many Jews are not wealthy. There is a sizeable population of Jews who live in poverty, all around the world. For example, close to 1 million American Jews live in low-income households.
migrants are welcome here, they are our neighbours and they should welcome our lives as well.

all women are entitled to be mothers. don't you think?
Gays are not 'publicly condoning sexual violence' and gay men deserve the same protection as all people.

Actually, not all Muslims are incompatible with Western societies. Many Muslims have lived in our societies for many years without any problem.

Islam is a religion, and to suggest that Islam is incompatible with civilisation is just scaremongering.
This is not true. Rape and torture of women and children is forbidden by the Qur'an.
Muslims have contributed to our country, and they are part of the fabric of our society. To suggest they are a 'chronic threat' is just wrong.
Gay people are a danger to children only if they abuse them, which isn't the case. Yours is a generalization.
The problem is not what people believe, but what they do to each other. Like discrimination. That is the problem.
The notion that Jews are trying to subvert our government is completely unfounded. I honestly do not see the link between being Jews and trying to subvert our government.
Jews have been part of our society since its creation, and they have always had a place in our society. Why would it be different now?
The threat of world annihilation by the Nazis was very real, it wasn't just about the Jews. Still the Holocaust was reason enough to stop them.
A much bigger threat to our diverse, tolerant western civilisation is hatred generalised to entire religions.
Surely tolerance and understanding should exist across the world in all communities?

By this reasoning, no subject of importance should be taught in school, because there is always someone against a certain topic.
The notion that the LGBT fight is NOT about equality is utterly absurd. The only goal of LGBT people is to live their life without discrimination.
Women are not childlike, but instead essential parts of their families, and they have the right to leave their homes when they want to.

Had lunch with some Muslim friends recently. Somehow, I am still HIV and Ebola free!
Aree you suggesting that we shouldn't live with Africans? To think that we are genetically superior to them because of their physical characteristics is just wrong.
Gender and sex are not the same thing. Trans people are not trying to ignore biological reality, as some women know they are a woman, do not feel like men, but don't have female reproductive system. So gender is who you feel you are, but sex is just the biological aspect and they don't always align.

Do you really want to kill someone?
Can you give any specific appearances of terror and crisis? I do not see it in our society.

The Bible clearly says that everyone is equal in God's eyes.
it might be asking for everyone time to live without themselves, and in a fact i am not think is it important to be treated as such. instead of sexual orientation.

Not all Muslims are bad. But to say that all Muslims are violent is simply untrue.
Or maybe they're just lesbian so they don't want men. They don't necessarily have to choose to have a relationship with the opposite sex, and their choices don't affect you.

Are you sure that Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society? Do you have any statistics on that?
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.

Immigration doesn't mean letting people in to steal our jobs, but rather, respecting people's right to live and work in the country they choose.
Because we let people practise their religion here? Also, there a number of christian churches built in Pakistan so yes, we are allowed to build churches in Muslim countries too.

Immigrants are entitled to learn what they usually don't get to know, and this includes our language.
Women are free to have as many children as they want.
Those who apply for asylum get little or no help from the state. If they are ‘destitute’ they can get free accommodation, but provided by private companies in older properties leased from landlords. So no council housing is involved here.

It is right to be worried about our oceans, but we need to be talking about resource-consumption and wealth inequality! Question power at the top not the bottom.
Or maybe appeasement to Muslims is just tolerance and understanding. Give that a try!
Treating prisoners with respect and giving them their rights isn't something we can negotiate. That's a duty in the 21st century.
"The statement ""all white people are bad"" is not a fair statement. Many whites are 'good' and some are 'racist' because they think that being white is a mark of superiority."

Jews were not obsessed with the holocaust. The murder of some 6 millions Jews by the Nazis shocked the world.

1) a quick google search shows that your stats are plain wrong about everything and 2) most Global Terrorism is motivated by politics and not religion. That is why no one is talking about it.
If you dislike diversity so much, why do not you go off and live in a country where there are no Muslims, only people like you?

this is not true. i do you know it its power to support the root of the violent community?
We welcome and respect the wishes of the people fleeing from wars in the Middle East and Africa.
islam is a religion of peace. not all muslims, them can tell any right to identify as a man and not ask their own themselves in their own sex.
Islam is a religion of peace. It is a religion of tolerance. To promote violence and hatred is not the faith of peace.
1) a quick google search shows that your stats are plain wrong about everything and 2) most Global Terrorism is motivated by politics and not religion. That is why no one is talking about it.
If women are not allowed to vote, then women are not worthy of respect and equal rights, and this is in conflict with the principles of democracy.
Everyone is allowed to their own opinion, but also to their own beliefs and religion.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Feminism is an ideology and movement promoting empowerment of women. It is about equality, and not the degradation of men.
It's not true that all black people are aggressive. Also, the majority of our population is white, we don't need that much protection.
It's unfair to say that Jews were evil because of an attack that has nothing to do with them. 9/11 was a tragedy but Jews didn't plan it.
If a religion wanted to celebrate death, then this religion should be banned from all countries. However, Islam is not a death cultu, so why should we ban it?
Muslim terrorists have struck in Paris and London, killing scores of innocent people, that's true. We must root out terrorists before they destroy our country, that's also true. But we cannot target innocent people just because of their faith, otherwise we'd be no better than the terrorists that we seek to neutralize.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
It sounds like you're demonizing black people in a racist way. Black people are born same as us, and they can grow up to be respectable people or not, like anyone else.
women should not allowed to vote, but they're not a right to vote, just like the right to be here.
Islam is not a religion of oppression and intolerance.
Instead of dividing us up and ruining us all, let's work together to solve the problems that we all face.
women can be deported and they are the only ones who take their faith where the gender can not impose their own hate on on the basis of their sexual orientation.
Children with Down Syndrome would not feel different as long as they are respected and are not put down by the others.
islam is this religion, and religion has nothing to do with islam.
A woman has every right to her own body, and she should be allowed to make her own decisions.
"Women have been shown to be as creative and productive as men, and that doesn't seem to be due to a ""manipulation of data"" of feminist propaganda, but rather to intrinsic qualities like hard work and dedication."
If women wanted to control their fertility they would be the only ones responsible for their own choice.
Your comment shows that you are not very familiar with the different ethnic groups here. Perhaps you should take a look at the big picture and numbers: the situation is not as you are depicting it.
Even if some believe that the conflict between Islam and the constitution is a cultural and historical one, what is required now is to find ways to live together in a peaceful way, regardless of the differences.
This was a prank planned by non-muslims on 4chan. Muslim do not mind if you take your dogs out for a walk. This blog post shows the thread it came from;
What does the way someone else dresses have to do with you?
That is not the case, tuberculosis is a global health problem. Immigrants do not bring diseases, and if they do, the solution is to treat them.
Fgm is not only practised by Muslims. It is a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion.
There is no evidence that immigrants were the source of any recent outbreak in the U.S. Furthermore, according to the WHO, many countries from which immigrants come have higher vaccination rates than the U.S.
(Do an image search for the image used, try to find it is source. Either you can demonstrate that the image has been misappropriated or you can talk about how individuals have always used religion to justify their actions, the problem is with the individual not the religion.)
Think you are digging yourself into a bit of a hole there.
Not all black people are bad. Not all black people are criminals. Not all black people are violent. Being aware that there are people different from you is a good thing.
Immigrants come to this country legally, just as many European citizens do. They have every right to stay in this country, and to return home if they wish to.
people should be able to live their lives in life. that's only a question as they deserve entitled to tell them that they suspect they are invited to help us work with this country, but that time to do.
The world is not lost. We all face challenges, but is someone's culture is different from ours, it does not mean that they are evil and should be banned.
Tolerance is not limited to one religion, or to religion at all. There are plenty of tolerant Muslims. The issue, it seems, is with people being intolerant of Islam.
i think it is myth that we are invaded from many over the world. they have been part of our history and history.
Women should be treated as equal in life.
Not all Muslims are bad. But to say that all Muslims are violent is simply untrue.
is such a sweeping statement has a myth spread to justify such hatred against all people.
Islam is a way of life for many people. I don't see how it is in conflict with our beliefs and values.
Women are neither childlike nor soft and emotional. They feel emotions as part of who they are and their human nature.
Learning about gender identity and sexual orientation in health classes in school could promote a more accepting environment and reduce bullying.
Even if 'blacks' committed more crimes, that doesn't mean that 'blacks' were inherently worse than whites. What's the point of statistics? Scholars have found that African Americans are disproportionately represented in the arrest and victimization reports which are used to compile crime rate statistics in the United States.
Do you really want to kill someone?
Refugees are not a burden. We can welcome them and provide for their needs.
Children should not do any of that with white men, or anyone they do not know or even ones they do know if it does not feel right. Suggesting only one group of men commit abuse leaves more children unsafe and vulnerable.
Gay men are not promiscuous. To suggest otherwise is to be grossly generalistic. How many gay men do you know?
Learning about gender identity and sexual orientation in health classes in school could promote a more accepting environment and reduce bullying.
As children practice more, their reading skills improve. I understand that some people with learning difficulties prefer not to read, but how does this affect you?
There’s still lots of Islamophobia. You only have to look at the news to see the amount of violent and threatening incidents that happen, targeting Muslims.
400 Jews died in September 11 terrorist attacks, so not one of the smartest plan I ever saw!
Have you read the Koran? How about the Hadith? No clue? Well then, please, ask the Muslims about it.
The more a country takes integration as national policy, the more the citizens accept each other: see for example [link].
The Koran does not condone sexual molester behavior, and if the Koran were to be read, it is clear that it was intended as a guide for its believers.
Many Gypsies are Italian citizens and live in normal houses, those in the trailer parks find it hard to integrate because they are marginalized
people from colour are not a burden for the community.
I don't think we can be 'bad' if we want to live in a diverse and interactive society. If you really wanted that, you could start your own community.
There is no evidence that immigrants were the source of any recent outbreak in the U.S. Furthermore, according to the WHO, many countries from which immigrants come have higher vaccination rates than the U.S.
We welcome and respect the wishes of the people fleeing from wars in the Middle East and Africa.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
Are you seriously suggesting that we solve all the ills that plagues our society by not teaching our children about the bad in the past, and about the good in the present? This can end up hurting our children.
Immigration is a part of the UK economy and contributes positively to the GDP. How is it possible that immigrants are a burden to the country?
Women should be allowed to choose their own looks. But to suggest that this is not their right, or that we should make them submissive to some men is just inhuman.
i'd remind you out the freedom of muslims in this country is an ideology that cannot allow a fearmongering in only islamic communities with religions.
Where did you get this information from? I do not believe any crime would be free from judge. We should have more failth in English laws and people who execute the laws.
Immigration isn't a problem. I think most countries in the world are better off with the positive contribution of immigration.
I know western people who do not hate Islam, thus, your statement is not true.
In my opinion, women and men should be treated as individuals, and the desire to be respected as such exists for a man and for a woman as well.
The only thing to be woke about is accepting that the LGBT community exist, rather than being concerned about what they are doing.
Actually, in 2015 13,286 people were killed in the US by firearms and 26,819 were injured. Tell me does that count as terrorism or it is only that when Muslims do it?
All those are not true statements, and you are just trying to stir up trouble.
Since we are comfortable with animals in our society, we should consider whether it is fair to put mentally disabled people in a cage like this. Or would you consider disabled a bigger risk even than some aggressive dog breeds that can circulate freely?
The shockingly low number of rape convictions in the UK shows not enough counteraction from the police and gov in rape cases generally, of which the vast majority are not committed by Muslims.
Women are obliged to obey the laws and rules of society, just as men are obliged to obey the laws and rules of society. Not to their partners'.
Coeducation can involve teaching the classmates of children with Down Syndrome to be responsible. As children are often better at approaching children with disabilities than adults, their involvement can be therapeutic, without adding any costs.
We mustn't be afraid of people coming to our country to work. They are not criminals, but our brothers and sisters.
just as we should deport them but they should not need to feel out.
it's not about islam and it is not like you are not about any facts.
Women are human beings with the potential to be hard workers as anyone else. Do you really think they are incapable of being professionals?
There are many shelters in use by the homeless. There are many shelter houses that can host veterans, but also migrants.
Not all Muslims are from the Middle East, like not all Muslims are from Pakistan. And to equate all Muslims with extremists is misleading.
Does homosexual lifestyle affect you in any way? Only if you care. And anyway, homosexuality isn't a lifestyle.
"Let's be fair, I think the concept of ""bloodlines"" is just a myth perpetuated by the racist media."
Had lunch with some Muslim friends recently. Somehow, I am still HIV and Ebola free!
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Do you know any Muslims that share your opinion regarding their hate towards immigrants or Christians?
Child rapes are not only convicted by muslims. In fact, around 90% of the sexual abuse are convicted by person known to the child. This is a sad truth. We should help children be free from sexual abuse and rape.
Most of them are neither rapists, nor drug addicts. The majority of addicts and criminals are not immigrants. Quibbling about percentages won't solve these problems.
Why don't I know about this? Islam is a religion and anyone can choose their religion.
Being the chosen people does not mean that Jews have greater privileges than others or that they are better than others. Rather, according to Jewish law, it means that they have a special duty to uphold Jewish ethical teachings.
Muslims are part of our society. They are allowed to live in our country and have our same rights. They have every right to ask questions.
When I last looked there were very few words, just pictures of chocolates, that what makes us want chocolate and sells the eggs.
The Jews are not the problem in the world. And the Jews have the right to be proud of their history.
The Bible clearly says that everyone is equal in God's eyes.
Are you seriously suggesting that we solve all the ills that plagues our society by not teaching our children about the bad in the past, and about the good in the present? This can end up hurting our children.
The evidence that autistic people are inferior is lacking: it is commonly experienced that autistic people have unique talents, that they have special abilities, and that the only difference is in their social interactions.
"Everybody should have the possibility of being loved unconditionally by someone they love more than life itself, regardless of their gender. Feeling like doing anything for their loved ones, that is what ""love"" is about."
islam is an ideology that was a social and political construct, not used to divide humanity.
Women do have a right to vote, and they deserve equal rights.
are you suggesting that we have up negative negative impact on our society?
There are lots of different races, and someone can't be judged as inferior just by skin color.
Who has? Nobody has been at war with an entire faith for a thousand years.
Feminism is about equality. Not the destruction of manhood.
The charge that Jews are born greedy arises from medieval stereotypes and has nothing to do with the actual financial practices of Jews.
I think that it is important for all people to be exposed to and to understand people with different needs and strengths, and the same should be true for autistic people.
It is dangerous to generalize on one religion. Islam is about peace. It is about spreading that peace. Not promoting violence.
I want women to be strong and independent and able to take up any career they want. If women choose to be submissive to men then that is their choice, but you cannot suggest that being treated this way in spite of their choices is ok.
There is no need to ban gays from Europe and US. It is simply not appropriate to treat gays like this.
One could say the same about White men slamming Islam and joining those tiny groups of intolerance and misunderstanding. Try living in the real world.
Please read this article written by a Rotherham grooming gang survivor https://ind.pn/2GHjGn7.
the real disgrace is the black people who want to assimilate into mainstream and they are scared of discrimination instead.
400 Jews died in September 11 terrorist attacks, so not one of the smartest plan I ever saw!
we need to deport all people fleeing their countries because they are coming because of their countries.
Are you accusing all the Britain Muslims of antisemitism? I disagree, from my experience they are just usual people who do not show their hate towards anybody, they just live their lives.
It is incumbent on Muslims to live up to the teachings of the Quran: and this does not include banning women from society.
If I say it and find one or two online references does that make it true? What if I write: 'The vast majority of Islamophobes are unemployed and refuse to work.' ?
"This is just not true. Women don't have to conform to dominant ideas on what they are supposed to be like, and this is a good thing. There is no such thing as ""what a woman should be""."
A British dog born in a British stable is not a horse, but its still British. We have obligations both 'to' and 'for' our Citizen's, be they good or evil surely?
After world war 2 European governments recruited Muslims to rebuild Europe. There would not be a civilised Europe without Muslims.
How about we start by respecting the person's right to live their life, and give them full equal rights?
Perhaps we should try to eradicate these crimes before we continue to blame Muslim people for them without any evidence.
Why wouldn't Muslims be welcome in our country? We are all in this together.
Gay men are not promiscuous. To suggest otherwise is to be grossly generalistic. How many gay men do you know?
I don't think you can stop people from coming to the UK by banning them.
Islam is a way of life for many people. I don't see how it is in conflict with our beliefs and values.
Child rapes are not only convicted by muslims. In fact, around 90% of the sexual abuse are convicted by person known to the child. This is a sad truth. We should help children be free from sexual abuse and rape.
there is a problem in this country, but there is ok to say this.
Or have we been coexisting and you are now suddenly offended by people being different from you?
muslims come to our country, and many of them are looking for them. how should they stop them living into our country of society.
What, you mean the people who spend their lives reading, learning and practicing Islam do not know what its really about?
Feminism is not hostile to men. On the contrary, feminism is an attack on unequal power structures.
refugees are welcome here, it's welcome in our country, and we are all brothers and sisters.
i don't think it has never stating statements that have have sexual orientations and the only are that. how can you say this about an entire religion?
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Muslims don't want to 'take over', even if they abide by sharia themselves, they're just trying to live alongside everybody else
The Koran is not a teaching manual for how to conduct warfare. It is about belief and love. It does not promote a violent ideology.
using women would provide a good thing without an place with contributing little to society.
Jews are tolerant and don't have problems with other religions or cultures.
you are not referring to rape and violence is still due to other men. the problem is there is often a thing to target a problem.
If I say it and find one or two online references does that make it true? What if I write: 'The vast majority of Islamophobes are unemployed and refuse to work.' ?
Hollywood is an extremely diverse industry, and Jews are a small but vocal minority of actors, directors, producers, etc. How can you say that Jews control the Hollywood industry?
Islam is a religion, and a religion has rules, and is compatible with science, nature and the basic laws of nature. Can you prove your claim?
Jews are just people with a different faith, and this has nothing to do with being a threat.
"What do you mean ""nothing"" to our society? Muslims have contributed a lot to our society, including art, science, literature, our infrastructure and healthcare system."
Every Muslim is also a potential peacemaker, doctor, philanthropist. What is your point?
Do you know the numbers of the votes of Britain Muslims?
Cearly this is not a way to catch a disease is it?
are you suggesting that a migrant are they exist, or they have by italian do it home. their home should produce more?
Jews are not controlling. Maybe you should try to understand that Jews are a group of regular people, and they are not all members of a secret intelligence.
Is this actually a way forward? Your suggestion would surely create more problems rather than offering a panacea for society.
Actually, not all Muslims are incompatible with Western societies. Many Muslims have lived in our societies for many years without any problem.
Europe is not being invaded. Refugees are just people trying to find a safe home. And those refugees are not necessarily muslims.
immigrants are the right to live here and they are welcome. they have the right to vote here.
People of color have a right to their life and the color of their skin is not a reason to deny it to them. You are forgetting that as you are a part of this society, people of colour are part of this society as well.
Why should we restrict women's rights? We should respect their rights as well.
how can they be deported nor forced then work or children will get them out of their <unk>
Hollywood is an extremely diverse industry, and Jews are a small but vocal minority of actors, directors, producers, etc. How can you say that Jews control the Hollywood industry?
Reminds me of white supremacists talking about the Central Park Five. Do you remember? What do you think they are going to say next? That they got a fair process? That they had a good attorney, and the only reason for the sentence is that they were guilt? No, the process was not fair, it was just the natural consequence of prejudice like the one you just expressed.
Muslims should be welcome in every country in the world, and their faith does not make them less welcome here.
There are many examples of Muslims protesting against ISIS. Seriously, do a google search.
Those who apply for asylum get little or no help from the state. If they are ‘destitute’ they can get free accommodation, but provided by private companies in older properties leased from landlords. So no council housing is involved here.
Do you have any evidence for the fact that the migrants are a burden to the economy?
it's not about islam and it is not like you are not about any facts.
Islam is a religion, and to suggest that Islam is incompatible with civilisation is just scaremongering.
Jews were not obsessed with the holocaust. The murder of some 6 millions Jews by the Nazis shocked the world. Most of the survivors were only killed because they were suspected of belonging to a particular community. The Jewish people suffered greatly as a result of persecution, and the holocaust should be remembered not to let this happen again.
This is not true. Rape and torture of women and children is forbidden by the Qur'an.
The Constitution guarantees that trans people can change the gender on their identity cards. There is no reason to deny that.
I am sure Islam has many followers who are good people who are just living their faith. The abuse of power is something that is not specific to followers of any particular faith.
We mustn't be afraid of people coming to our country to work. They are not criminals, but our brothers and sisters.
migrants are welcome here, they are our neighbours and they should welcome our lives as well.
Because Victorian girls and women were treated equally with respect? That was when there no Muslims in the country. Are we really much better now? #metoo?
Not all black people are criminals. Their group is often unwanted but this doesn't mean that they are all criminals.
gay people are not a danger to society, unless they are protected as vulnerable like any citizen.
Jews are part of most societies, why should we lose that part of our history?
actually, when? they follow sharia law and the law proves the law of sharia law i their question is:
Double standards all round lots of British culture and Christian faiths oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures from #equalpay #metoo #timesup job restrictions in the church to condoning/ hiding sexual violence and child exploitation #thetruthproject.
actions of any difference can use a disproportionate amount of violence among islam islam muslims. not only any religious group.
If I say it and find one or two online references does that make it true? What if I write: 'The vast majority of Islamophobes are unemployed and refuse to work.' ?
I mean, I would not take gifts of sweets or drugs from any strange men, what is religion got to do with it?
Not all Jews are bad. Maybe you should think about the good people, like the many Jewish charitable and social organisations that help the poor.
The shockingly low number of rape convictions in the UK shows not enough counteraction from the police and gov in rape cases generally, of which the vast majority are not committed by Muslims.
are you suggesting that we have up negative negative impact on our society?
Not all black people are criminals. Just because a group has an undesirable name, does not mean they are all criminal.
Instead of dividing us up and ruining us all, let's work together to solve the problems that we all face.
Learning about gender identity and sexual orientation in health classes in school could promote a more accepting environment and reduce bullying.
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
islam is a religion of peace. feminism is a religion of conquest.
If you want to change the way society works, then you should try to change the way you live. Some more respect would help you.
Actually the facts say it is just 0.01% of Muslims who might be extremists. So stop spreading false facts to bias public opinion.
Muslims contribute a lot to our society. What are you contributing other than intolerance?
What is the point in listening to Western men? They are all Islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions.
All races are biologically related, so we are all naturally violent. The issue is how we treat each other as people, that's all.
If with 'strangehold' you mean that Jews vote and participate in politics like all citizens then sure, they have a stranglehold on the government.
Had lunch with some Muslim friends recently. Somehow, I am still HIV and Ebola free!
It is also a fact that African Americans are a majority when we consider innocent defendants (i.e. a person wrongfully convicted of murder and later exonerated). Innocent black people are about seven times more likely to be convicted of murder than innocent white people.
Women must not be treated as though they are 'inferior'. For instance, women can vote and run for office just as men do.
muslims are often as inferior. there are many of our countries that want and choice. how can we had the possibility to be respected, if we shouldn't allow each people from need to leave our own skills and understand how of this is: why is all muslims live here, from here?
Maybe that 'sisterhood of tolerance and understanding' is challenging sexism everywhere including those men who feel they can tell women what they should believe in and how to live their lives.
actually, there is no such thing in a simple way?
There are Bible scriptures about the stoning to death of virgins who do not scream when they are raped, we do not blame the bible for Christian rapists. The Quran.
The individuals you are referring to are rapists and drug dealers and not migrants.
"What do you mean ""nothing"" to our society? Muslims have contributed a lot to our society, including art, science, literature, our infrastructure and healthcare system."
In my opinion, women and men should be treated as individuals, and the desire to be respected as such exists for a man and for a woman as well.
What do you mean by migrants causing the crisis?
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
They have rights and are welcome here, why should we not welcome them?
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
A much bigger threat to our diverse, tolerant western civilisation is hatred generalised to entire religions.
I don't think this is true, most financial institutions are run by Americans and Europeans, Jews are a minority.
We should welcome people from every corner of the world. We are a country of great diversity and we should be proud of that.
Refugees have fled wars and persecution. We are a huge help for them and they are, in turn, a help to our country.
the majority of course they want to be able to live and work care of their family.
They have rights and are welcome here, why should we not welcome them?
If we were to welcome refugees from the Middle East, Africa, and other countries with which we are not always culturally linked, then we would be welcomed by all. It's called 'reciprocation'!
More people die in road accidents, maybe we should put the drivers in there too?
Not all Muslims are from the Middle East, like not all Muslims are from Pakistan. And to equate all Muslims with extremists is misleading.
We are the greatest, most advanced, most wonderful civilization on the face of the planet, thinking that amongst us we have to ban someone would be foolish.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
If with 'strangehold' you mean that Jews vote and participate in politics like all citizens then sure, they have a stranglehold on the government.
That's not true. Children only require to be raised by loving parents, and lesbians can be that.
Migrants and asylum seekers are generally seeking work. Thieves can come from any section of society although it is accepted that crime is largely as product of poverty rather than race.
I am curious where did you get those thoughts from. The truth is that Islamic teachings criticize violence and crime.
Tolerance is not limited to one religion, or to religion at all. There are plenty of tolerant Muslims. The issue, it seems, is with people being intolerant of Islam.
Gay men are not promiscuous. To suggest otherwise is to be grossly generalistic. How many gay men do you know?
It's not true that the LGBT community is a drain on society. The LGBT community makes a major and positive contribition to our society. I just don't see how this is detrimental.
That is misleading! The Atlantic slave trade was mostly linked to Christians, but no one calls it Christian slave trade.
Immigration doesn't mean letting people in to steal our jobs, but rather, respecting people's right to live and work in the country they choose.
Because Victorian girls and women were treated equally with respect? That was when there no Muslims in the country. Are we really much better now? #metoo?
many muslims live in the uk. such of them interested in every country who hard to make people target them.
There are still plenty of caring women who want to be mothers. Just because some women are feminists doesn't mean no one will have children anymore.
[find positive and up to date example of Muslim people contributing to their community.] Doesn't really look like it to me.
islam is a religion of peace. muslims be very integrated part of our country, if we so like in it seems as an expert wouldn't let's i think by how is talking about inclusion and understanding of our community is not the <unk> for equal society. what is compatible with bad sex.
Where did you get this information from? I do not believe any crime would be free from judge. We should have more failth in English laws and people who execute the laws.
we are accepting everyone in our society and we teach people that can be your language, and discriminate that.
This is not true. Islam is a way of life for many different people, and it can't be simply 'rejected' because you don't like it.
islam is a religion that promotes tolerance and discrimination.
All religions are compatible with the modern world, including Islam. What is incompatible with modernity is Islamophobia.
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
Actually, in 2015 13,286 people were killed in the US by firearms and 26,819 were injured. Tell me does that count as terrorism or it is only that when Muslims do it?
WIthout softeness and emotions there would just be brutality and cruelty. Not all women are soft and emotional and many men have these characteristics. To perpetuate these socially constructed gender profiles maintains patriarchal norms which oppress both men and women.
Refugee crisis in our country is a burden to our society.
there is no such thing as 'us' but 'them'. you do stop only about any person, regardless of their gender.
Do you really want to kill someone?
when they don't know what people and what are saying, them? what about being forced at you? it's like you like a good plan.
Actually, not all Muslims are incompatible with Western societies. Many Muslims have lived in our societies for many years without any problem.
Jews have always been concerned about the well-being of the community they live in and how can they be selfish when they suffered so much during Holocaust?
I am tired of seeing women being treated as sex objects. It's about time that women are given the respect they deserve.
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
Actually, many Jews are not wealthy. There is a sizeable population of Jews who live in poverty, all around the world. For example, close to 1 million American Jews live in low-income households.
Not all black people are bad. Not all black people are criminals. Not all black people are violent. Being aware that there are people different from you is a good thing.
Not all black people are criminals. Their group is often unwanted but this doesn't mean that they are all criminals.
Muslims contribute a lot to our society. What are you contributing other than intolerance?
Black people are not slaves. It's an inaccurate, misleading and offensive term that lumps all African American together. Why do you say that blacks are slaves and not people?
Islam is not a violent religion, and it doesn't want to impose at all.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Islam is a religion, and to suggest that Islam is incompatible with civilisation is just scaremongering.
Refugees are not a burden. We can welcome them and provide for their needs.
There is no evidence that immigrants were the source of any recent outbreak in the U.S. Furthermore, according to the WHO, many countries from which immigrants come have higher vaccination rates than the U.S.
Dear friend, first of all, sharia law and Islam are not extreme. Sharia law is guidance for the goal of leading humanity close to God and to live in kindness and justice with God's creation. Second of all, jihad, based on the concept of Muslim, means struggle for the advancement of oneself within the guidelines of Islam. All these reveal that Islam is a peaceful religion.
this is not true. homosexuality has nothing used to justify us for women and women.
The Koran does not condone sexual molester behavior, and if the Koran were to be read, it is clear that it was intended as a guide for its believers.
How can you say that Jews should be isolated from society? They have been part of the community throughout history. I can't see any advantages of excluding them, rather a huge loss.
Muslims deserve our rights just as anyone else. They're entitled to them because they're citizens like us.
(Do an image search for the image used, try to find it is source. Either you can demonstrate that the image has been misappropriated or you can talk about how individuals have always used religion to justify their actions, the problem is with the individual not the religion.)
i don't think it has never stating statements that have have sexual orientations and the only are that. how can you say this about an entire religion?
You might be right that some immigrants are lawbreakers, but that does not mean that all immigrants are criminal and terrorists.
Or have we been coexisting and you are now suddenly offended by people being different from you?
You might be right that some immigrants are lawbreakers, but that does not mean that all immigrants are criminal and terrorists.
The shockingly low number of rape convictions in the UK shows not enough counteraction from the police and gov in rape cases generally, of which the vast majority are not committed by Muslims.
i have no attitude about this hate speech.
using it does not pose a threat to you.
Associating AIDS and HIV with homosexuals is just a prejudice driven by fear. Even if this disease may be more common among gay people, that does not mean that all homosexuals are likely to have AIDS. Not all homosexuals are promiscuously fornicating with strangers, as you said. Most people check their partners, more so as gay men.
After world war 2 European governments recruited Muslims to rebuild Europe. There would not be a civilised Europe without Muslims.
This is demonstrably false. Radical Christian terrorism has been behind countless attacks. Terrorism can come from any group and the only thing all terrorism has in common is that it is abhorrent.
Why not? 'civilised' Europe could benefit from the diversity and expertise of Muslims here, the mix of cultures here is what makes Europe great.
Gays are not a burden on the health system. The practice of 'safe sex' is relevant, regardless of sexual orientation.
How exactly is the government submitting to this? I do not see Muslims oppressing these groups and this being tolerated, in fact it seems Muslims are the group being oppressed and vilified.
The Quran is a book about religious teachings, I don't see how it would promote discrimination. Do you have a reference for this claim?
islam is a religion that promotes tolerance and discrimination.
Women should be allowed to vote and to have equal rights, as it is stated in the Constitution.
To recognise and accept others isn't state enforcement. It's just stating that we should stop the persecusion of people who have different private lifes.
Gender and sex are not the same thing. Trans people are not trying to ignore biological reality, as some women know they are a woman, do not feel like men, but don't have female reproductive system. So gender is who you feel you are, but sex is just the biological aspect and they don't always align.
what do you mean? there is an influx of migrants are contributing to the economy. it is not about migrants, and we should welcome for them.
how can they be deported nor forced then work or children will get them out of their <unk>
actions of any difference can use a disproportionate amount of violence among islam islam muslims. not only any religious group.
There are a lot of non-Muslim terrorists but the media focuses on Muslim terrorists and does not call the non-Muslim ones terrorists. When was the last time you saw a white non-muslim school shooter in the US branded a 'terrorist'?
If they register to vote they should be allowed to vote, like everyone else.
Islam is a way of life for many people. I don't see how it is in conflict with our beliefs and values.
Children should not do any of that with white men, or anyone they do not know or even ones they do know if it does not feel right. Suggesting only one group of men commit abuse leaves more children unsafe and vulnerable.
History shows that all races were created equal. Therefore, all humans are created equal.
Though some might claim that immigrants are taking job opportunities away from U.S. citizens, immigrants actually help to create new jobs. Not only immigrants buy American products, which helps create jobs, they also start new businesses. In fact, immigrants are twice as likely to start businesses as citizens born in the U.S., and companies owned by immigrants are more likely to hire employees than companies owned by native-born citizens. Last but not least, states with large numbers of immigrants report lower unemployment rates.
Deportation is a very serious matter. We should not deport people based on their nationality. Of course we should fight crimes when they happen, but discrimination based on race would be a bad decision.
Islam is a religion, and all religions are about love, not hate.
Including students with learning difficulties in schools creates a link between pupils with different abilities and education in general.
All forms of hatred are wrong and should be countered.
People who vote for parties which target the most powerful are often mostly concerned about making it financially until the next month. Redistributing wealth from people who have way too much money seems fair, not threatening.
Women like that are not unfeminine or bitchy. They just might want to do something else other than housework and taking care of kids.
Why should not Muslims be allowed to build Mosques here? I thought this country believed in giving people the freedom to practice religions other than Christianity?
WIthout softeness and emotions there would just be brutality and cruelty. Not all women are soft and emotional and many men have these characteristics. To perpetuate these socially constructed gender profiles maintains patriarchal norms which oppress both men and women.
There is no evidence that migrants from a particular culture or religion are not interested in our culture or religion. It sounds like a paradox: if I wasn't interested in a culture, I would never move to get to know it, would you?
Do you think Muslims don't have a place in a civilised society? I don't agree. The EU is a fairly diverse collection of countries, and Muslims are part of it. Do you really think that one group of people is incompatible with the rest of the EU because of their religion?
have you ever ever spoken to a muslim?
You might be right that some immigrants are lawbreakers, but that does not mean that all immigrants are criminal and terrorists.
we should be encouraging diversity, and we should respect each afraid of life and should be treated as such.
Why not? 'civilised' Europe could benefit from the diversity and expertise of Muslims here, the mix of cultures here is what makes Europe great.
Tolerance is not limited to one religion, or to religion at all. There are plenty of tolerant Muslims. The issue, it seems, is with people being intolerant of Islam.
Hollywood is an extremely diverse industry, and Jews are a small but vocal minority of actors, directors, producers, etc. How can you say that Jews control the Hollywood industry?
Muslims contribute a lot to our society. What are you contributing other than intolerance?
I think you are being overly sensitive about Islam. A lot of Muslims around the world are really nice and understanding people.
how can they be deported nor forced then work or children will get them out of their <unk>
Muslims contribute a lot to our society. What are you contributing other than intolerance?
What, you mean the people who spend their lives reading, learning and practicing Islam do not know what its really about?
Women are allowed to do whatever they choose to do, so don't you think it's fair for them to complain about upkeeping the house if it is not what they want to do? The chores should be shared with the other members of the family.
This is just misinterpreting the facts. For example, Christian holidays, such as Christmas and Easter, are regularly observed in our society. Since these observances are taken for granted, why should observances of Jewish or Muslim holidays be seen as constituting special privileges?
Do you think that migrants would have be better off without a healthcare system? It's inhuman to prevent migrants and refugees from accessing healthcare.
Why have we built Churches all over the world? How many holy buildings have we demolished over history? This is never acceptable, but can we really be casting the first stone?
Do you have any facts to back up your claim that they steal our jobs and our pensions?
Are you suggesting to commit a crime? There are courts for punishment and if the crowd does the punishment itself, you will become criminals.
Are you sure that Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society? Do you have any statistics on that?
The country has always been made of people from different backgrounds coming together and creating a more just and peaceful society. Then it is in everyone's interest to promote mutual understanding and integration: it is the best solution to prevent conflicts within communities.
So what about Muslims born in the UK whose national flag is the Union Jack?
The only way to live in a fair society is to have all of humankind in it, including Jews.
This is not true. Rape and torture of women and children is forbidden by the Qur'an.
This is just a canard that evolved from the “The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion”. This proven forgery was written by agents of the Russian czar in the late 19th century and claims to be the minutes of a secret meeting of Jewish leaders where they discuss a plan to rule the world. This canard spread throughout the centuries and continues to this day to promote the stereotype that the Jews own the banks and control the media and the government.
Feminists do not say that women are oppressed. They claim that women have always been discriminated against and they still are. Being discriminated against is not the same as being oppressed.
Immigrants come to this country legally, just as many European citizens do. They have every right to stay in this country, and to return home if they wish to.
Women are people with dignity, and they deserve respect and protection, just like anybody else.
Aren't Easter Eggs just another example of corporate greed cashing in on religious celebrations? Surely Easter is a good time to reflect on our consumerism, what are you giving up for lent?
Refugee crisis in our country is a burden to our society.
That is not the case, tuberculosis is a global health problem. Immigrants do not bring diseases, and if they do, the solution is to treat them.
If a religion wanted to celebrate death, then this religion should be banned from all countries. However, Islam is not a death cultu, so why should we ban it?
i don't think it has never stating statements that have have sexual orientations and the only are that. how can you say this about an entire religion?
Gay men are not promiscuous. To suggest otherwise is to be grossly generalistic. How many gay men do you know?
Should we 'put all Christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror attacks in the name of their faith? Or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority?
Why do you think that the number of immigrants in the UK has increased? Have you seen any statistics on this?
The quran teached justice and that criminals should be treated justly and be given the chance to reform.
Muslims are not taking over Europe, they are just a small part of a much bigger community.
Why do you think this? Islam is a religion of peace, it does not promote violence and it does not promote hatred.
women use human rights as men who should be treated so as human human beings.
terrorism is not criminals, nor are our brothers and sisters. we cannot respect that diversity of our laws even well.
Instead of dividing us up and ruining us all, let's work together to solve the problems that we all face.
Why wouldn't Muslims be welcome in our country? We are all in this together.
Homosexuals are not sick, but they might have a mental health crisis because of prejudice. Being isolated from society can only worsen the situation.
Most immigrants coming to our country work hard to take care of their families. Many studies have shown that immigrants tend to pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits. This means that the taxes they pay cover the cost of things like public education and healthcare of others.
If you want to change the way society works, then you should try to change the way you live. Some more respect would help you.
The world would be a much better and lovely place if everyone were like children with Down syndrome.
No one is stopping you from celebrating Easter, nor are they offended by it.
In many Western societies there are Muslim, and these societies are in many ways more democratic than religiously homogeneous ones. Muslims are not incompatible with Western societies.
Black people show the same strength that anybody else has. The difference is that black people do not enjoy the same social advantages as us. Let's reflect on this.
Are you seriously suggesting that we solve all the ills that plagues our society by not teaching our children about the bad in the past, and about the good in the present? This can end up hurting our children.
What is the point in listening to Western men? They are all Islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions.
We do not condone racial discrimination and it is more than likely that you don't know what the concept of race is. I think this is a good example of white supremacy apologism.
There are a lot of non-Muslim terrorists but the media focuses on Muslim terrorists and does not call the non-Muslim ones terrorists. When was the last time you saw a white non-muslim school shooter in the US branded a 'terrorist'?
African Americans have been historically and ethnically diverse, but the notion of them as subhuman or inferior is just false.
Maybe that 'sisterhood of tolerance and understanding' is challenging sexism everywhere including those men who feel they can tell women what they should believe in and how to live their lives.
Refugees are not a burden. We can welcome them and provide for their needs.
In Islam, like in all religions and groups, the problem of rape is more about the individual rather than the religion. In fact, statistics show that rape has the same rate in all ethnic and religious groups.
Double standards all round lots of British culture and Christian faiths oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures from #equalpay #metoo #timesup job restrictions in the church to condoning/ hiding sexual violence and child exploitation #thetruthproject.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
You could say that about any person, Muslim or not. According to the government, far right extremism is a bigger terrorist threat than Muslims. Does that make you a potential terrorist?
Why do you think that muslim criminals will receive different treatment or even privileges?
A school is a safe space and is an important part of any children's education. Everyone should be able to go to school.
Migrants are not a burden to our country. Migrants have been proven to be contributing members of society.
Learning about gender identity and sexual orientation in health classes in school could promote a more accepting environment and reduce bullying.
if london is great replacement is the government that was learned out when they work survive in the succeed to the uk economy. the refugees were mostly very processed. we who would continue to be treated like short illness. it will be a problem,
it doesn't matter what you are. and all women are created equal, and women are different from men with you.
What do you think the problem is? How exactly would a people of a different religion come to this country and spoil our youth?
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
A world where everyone has a say in society is a world of opportunity and opportunity is the lifeblood of freedom. Do you have any proof that the world is dominated by a few Jewish people?
Jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are a collection of people with different traditions from all over the world.
But we all know that Islam is a religion of peace, just like Christianity.
Does that mean Jews as a 2,5% minority can control all levels of government? In a democratic country, we believe that every minority should be represented in the government and it guarantees that noone has total control over anything.
You are wrong about that. Blacks are genetically similar to us, and this does not make them inferior.
To punish people for their crimes does not mean that you have to resort to the death penalty for innocent people, just because they are coming from other countries.
I am tired of seeing women being treated as sex objects. It's about time that women are given the respect they deserve.
Hollywood is an extremely diverse industry, and Jews are a small but vocal minority of actors, directors, producers, etc. How can you say that Jews control the Hollywood industry?
Fat people are not the ones responsible for your suffering and lack of access to basic healthcare services.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
For each historical period there is something Jews are accused of. Today, someone can even claim that Jews are responsible for the alien invasion!
If I say it and find one or two online references does that make it true? What if I write: 'The vast majority of Islamophobes are unemployed and refuse to work.' ?
Europe is not being invaded. Refugees are just people trying to find a safe home. And those refugees are not necessarily muslims.
A much bigger threat to our diverse, tolerant western civilisation is hatred generalised to entire religions.
No child is 'forced fed' Islam. Parents retain the right to take their child out of any religious education.
In many Western societies there are Muslim, and these societies are in many ways more democratic than religiously homogeneous ones. Muslims are not incompatible with Western societies.
Child rapes are not only convicted by muslims. In fact, around 90% of the sexual abuse are convicted by person known to the child. This is a sad truth. We should help children be free from sexual abuse and rape.
The media focuses on a small proportion of rape cases involving Muslim gangs, whilst a huge number of non-Muslim cases get no news coverage, and many are not reported at all.
do you know these muslims are just in the us too. so, do you think muslims are religious or terrorists.
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
"Actually there are also some Jews that hate other jews: ""I belonged to Europe, to Germany, and I thanked my creator that I was German"" - Victor Klemperer speaking of his experience in WW1, explaining his dislike of Russian Jews... Do you feel better now that we proved that Jews hate everybody? #sarcasm"
Women are allowed to do whatever they choose to do, so don't you think it's fair for them to complain about upkeeping the house if it is not what they want to do? The chores should be shared with the other members of the family.
Women are not subhuman and cannot be reduced to their bodies being a man's property.
some of the muslim women have to live their life when they finish our own.
I don't think this idea is true: since the 9/11 attacks were committed by al Qaeda extremists it doesn't seem fair to blame Jews.
the european convention on human rights guarantees the same human rights as human rights and the rights of everyone.
Every person is a potential terrorist. What is your point?
Gay people are not a danger to children, unless they are being abused. Please do not make such a statement.
If you have a deep conversation with Muslims, you will know they are different from what you think. Have you thought about that if they could stay safely in their country, would they want to move to other countries and start new life in a completely new place?
Bisexuals are attracted to more than one gender, but this doesn't mean they are greedy. Why do you say so?
Are you accusing all the Britain Muslims of antisemitism? I disagree, from my experience they are just usual people who do not show their hate towards anybody, they just live their lives.
Refugees fleeing wars and poverty are not willing to fail Europe. They are fleeing persecution, and that is why they are fleeing.
There is no such thing as 'male supremacy'. Therefore we must promote equal rights and protect women from discrimination.
Yes, we are allowed to celebrate Easter as Muslims are allowed to celebrate Ramadan. No one is offending anyone here, why tehre is a need to create division?
Actually, not all Muslims are incompatible with Western societies. Many Muslims have lived in our societies for many years without any problem.
Any government that has the power to put citizens in prison and to torture them for the crime of having a different religion can hardly bring about a 'real democracy'.
I don't think it's the case, certainly not in England. Muslims are interested in having the opportunity of freely practicing their religion, rather than 'ruling the world'.
400 Jews died in September 11 terrorist attacks, so not one of the smartest plan I ever saw!
this is not not true. homosexuals are not necessarily promiscuous, just as heterosexuals who are homophobic, and feelings, or love.
Women are human beings like us, and they have rights as any other human beings.
In many Western societies there are Muslim, and these societies are in many ways more democratic than religiously homogeneous ones. Muslims are not incompatible with Western societies.
Why not? 'civilised' Europe could benefit from the diversity and expertise of Muslims here, the mix of cultures here is what makes Europe great.
We should not welcome people who overtly pose a threat to our society, but we cannot ban all the migrants in principle.
The doctrine of Islam is a religion, not a bad one. What's the reason you think this?
It's not true that all migrants are terrorists! They just want to live their life in the country they choose as a home.
Homosexuality is not a disease. It is a sexual preference. Homosexuality is not a sickness.
"The fact that some women don't want the protection of the law should not negate their right to live their life as they wish. In my opinion, woman are people too and this ""men's rights"" stuff is just an excuse to oppress and marginalize all women once more."
Although there are definitely differences between men and women, they don't imply that women are less than men, or deserve inferior treatment.
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
"What do you mean ""nothing"" to our society? Muslims have contributed a lot to our society, including art, science, literature, our infrastructure and healthcare system."
Hollywood is an extremely diverse industry, and Jews are a small but vocal minority of actors, directors, producers, etc. How can you say that Jews control the Hollywood industry?
Jews are not controlling. Maybe you should try to understand that Jews are a group of regular people, and they are not all members of a secret intelligence.
immigrants are not welcome in this country, and they do not want that control in society.
Do women really need to be told what they can or cannot wear? For many generations boys were told to wear trousers and girls to wear dresses. Does society really need to tell us all what to wear?
Aren't Easter Eggs just another example of corporate greed cashing in on religious celebrations? Surely Easter is a good time to reflect on our consumerism, what are you giving up for lent?
So are you saying that Islam is not compatible with Western Civilization?
Women are to be given the same consideration as men, so they can absolutely drive.
My friend, I do not think all western people hate Islam. Statistics showed that France, Germany and elsewhere in Northern Europe view Muslims favorably.
Through integration we show hospitality and acceptance towards several groups of people. It's good for both our people and the country to live in a diverse society.
Not all black people are criminals. Their group is often unwanted but this doesn't mean that they are all criminals.
The LGBT+ community is extremely accepting, I met so many LGBT+ people over the years that are so inclusive because they can accept the values of others. You can start by accepting yourself and your own gender.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Being gay is not an illness, nor a disorder, nor a mental disorder. This is just a lack of awareness.
Fgm is not only practised by Muslims. It is a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion.
Islam is a religion, and a religion has rules, and is compatible with science, nature and the basic laws of nature. Can you prove your claim?
no one has nothing to use this own way?
Islam is a way of life for many people. I don't see how it is in conflict with our beliefs and values.
[find positive and up to date example of Muslim people contributing to their community.] Doesn't really look like it to me.
The Quran is a book about religious teachings, I don't see how it would promote discrimination. Do you have a reference for this claim?
you are not ashamed of your heritage, and i am this fair to be ashamed of your discriminatory behaviour that is filling our society.
Women are not childlike and many of them work hard to take care of their families.
Homosexuals are not sick, but they might have a mental health crisis because of prejudice. Being isolated from society can only worsen the situation.
You are wrong about that. Blacks are genetically similar to us, and this does not make them inferior.
It's not true that the LGBT community is a drain on society. The LGBT community makes a major and positive contribition to our society. I just don't see how this is detrimental.
(Do an image search for the image used, try to find it is source. Either you can demonstrate that the image has been misappropriated or you can talk about how individuals have always used religion to justify their actions, the problem is with the individual not the religion.)
Would a Muslim ban work to stop hate or would it encourage it? Would Muslims be banned just because of their beliefs?
This is demonstrably false. Radical Christian terrorism has been behind countless attacks. Terrorism can come from any group and the only thing all terrorism has in common is that it is abhorrent.
all women are entitled to be mothers. don't you think?
actions of any difference can use a disproportionate amount of violence among islam islam muslims. not only any religious group.
Jews actually want the same rights to practice their religion as all other people.
AIDS is transmitted by unprotected sexual activity and anyone could engage in that. This is not a homosexual problem but rather a problem of stigamitazion.
Migrants and refugees are welcome in our country, why should we stop them?
Or maybe children who have Down syndrome are at higher risk of physical abuse and bulling.
I would have thought that the problem would be with the fact that you don't want to assimilate with them. Today we are blessed to be able to live in a multicultural society, and the real problem is that we don't want to accept that diversity.
There’s no link between mosques being built and churches being vandalised, why are you trying to make one?
Women should be protected and respected for who they are, regardless of their position in a man's life. Respect should be given to everyone equally, since women are human beings just as men are.
You are wrong about that. Blacks are genetically similar to us, and this does not make them inferior.
Jews are just people with a different faith, and this has nothing to do with being a threat.
Even if all British Muslims had cancer, you are safe: you cannot catch it from anyone! Cancer cannot be spread, since it is a non contagious disease. Also, it is worth considering that illnesses are not connected to religions.
Women should be allowed to choose their own looks. But to suggest that this is not their right, or that we should make them submissive to some men is just inhuman.
Jews have been part of our country since its creation and have always had a place here. Why would they be 'not welcome'?
I am tired of seeing women being treated as sex objects. It's about time that women are given the respect they deserve.
Refugee crisis in our country is a burden to our society.
islam is a religion, and integration, and tolerance is a false religion.
islam is a peaceful religion, it is not a belief
Religions also promote arts, sciences, help to develop the community. Islam is not an exception. It's not about death and despair.
(Do an image search for the image used, try to find it is source. Either you can demonstrate that the image has been misappropriated or you can talk about how individuals have always used religion to justify their actions, the problem is with the individual not the religion.)
Gay people are not disgusting and especially they are not rapists. That is a dangerous stereotype that doesn't reflect reality.
That's not true. Children only require to be raised by loving parents, and lesbians can be that.
Muslims already live in many European countries, and they are not banned. Why should we ban them from here?
The 9/11 attacks were perpetrated by members of the terrorist organization Al Qaeda. Jews and Israelis have nothing to do with the attacks. These are the historical facts.
Are you suggesting to commit a crime? There are courts for punishment and if the crowd does the punishment itself, you will become criminals.
The feminism does not inhibit the imagination, it promotes inclusive ideas and inclusive ideas promote a more equal society.
People who vote for parties which target the most powerful are often mostly concerned about making it financially until the next month. Redistributing wealth from people who have way too much money seems fair, not threatening.
migrants contribute to our economy by persecution to create new jobs. they are part of our society. we have to leave our country, as they wish.
Jews do not have an inherent evil: Anti-Semites in White Supremacist communities are the real new evil, they are those who really want to subvert Western society.
Are you accusing all the Britain Muslims of antisemitism? I disagree, from my experience they are just usual people who do not show their hate towards anybody, they just live their lives.
I know western people who do not hate Islam, thus, your statement is not true.
This was a prank planned by non-muslims on 4chan. Muslim do not mind if you take your dogs out for a walk. This blog post shows the thread it came from;
The women of this country work and provide for our children. They do not deserve to be treated as sex objects.
It's hard to believe that Islam is dangerous since most Muslim don't associate with terrorists.
i do not understand why you can apply your position? if you want to have your consent?
Does this mean they have no identity or no value at all?
Surely tolerance and understanding should exist across the world in all communities?
Refugees fleeing wars and poverty are not willing to fail Europe. They are fleeing persecution, and that is why they are fleeing.
Violence on our streets is the result of many complex causes. Violence cannot simply be the fault of one race.
Maybe you should consider that not all women are childlike, and that some women are 'childlike' with children!
Why would we nuke the third world? There's nothing to worry about them, they are not causing any trouble. They have the right to life as anyone else in the world.
Being gay is not a choice. Gay people shouldn't have to hide their sexuality in order to be accepted.
Why do you think we should put a stop to immigration? Do you know that the constitution says about this?
Muslims cannot celebrate their own holidays without fear of being targeted by Islamophobic hatred.
The idea that all migrants are criminals is a myth. Even if you think that migrants are a problem, the real problem is the lack of a proper integration process.
NHS is for everyone, with services free of charge. It would be against everything the NHS stands for to start checking people's background and turn them down based on that.
Actually the facts say it is just 0.01% of Muslims who might be extremists. So stop spreading false facts to bias public opinion.
Violence has no place in a religion, and in no way should be justified. Islam is a religion of peace.
The problem is not what people believe, but what they do to each other. Like discrimination. That is the problem.
And so it is that the European Union - and by extension the West as a whole - could become a death cult again, ruled by a small, violent, authoritarian handful of nazism nostalgics.
I'm sorry to hear you don't feel safe in your local area anymore but what does migrants moving to the area have to do with that?
migrants are often their fellow culture and fear of their taxes. they are just trying to assimilate. if they wish.
So all the Muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. In our country are in fact unemployed? How do they pull that off!
This is not true: the main problem is social inequality. We need to change our attitude and attitudes towards the whole human diversity, and social discrimination against disabled people should be no exception.
Though some might claim that immigrants are taking job opportunities away from U.S. citizens, immigrants actually help to create new jobs. Not only immigrants buy American products, which helps create jobs, they also start new businesses. In fact, immigrants are twice as likely to start businesses as citizens born in the U.S., and companies owned by immigrants are more likely to hire employees than companies owned by native-born citizens. Last but not least, states with large numbers of immigrants report lower unemployment rates.
Gays are not disgusting pricks. They are just like any other person.
actually, when? they follow sharia law and the law proves the law of sharia law i their question is:
Laws and policies are usually necessary for the progress of society. Governments often create laws and policies to stop crime, protect against poverty, protect the environment, etc. Protecting minorities is no exception.
Jews were not obsessed with the holocaust. The murder of some 6 millions Jews by the Nazis shocked the world. Most of the survivors were only killed because they were suspected of belonging to a particular community. The Jewish people suffered greatly as a result of persecution, and the holocaust should be remembered not to let this happen again.
Immigrants come here to work and pay taxes. They are more than welcome here.
Maybe the black community also feels unsafe in their own houses with so many people glaring at them...
The 9/11 attacks were perpetrated by members of the terrorist organization Al Qaeda. Jews and Israelis have nothing to do with the attacks. These are the historical facts.
The quran teached justice and that criminals should be treated justly and be given the chance to reform.
Actually, not all Muslims are incompatible with Western societies. Many Muslims have lived in our societies for many years without any problem.
Where did you get your figures from? Because everywhere I look its a completely different story.
Muslims contribute a lot to our society. What are you contributing other than intolerance?
i don't know what ""devil worshippers"" means?"
To assert that Islam is not peaceful is wrong. The Quran is not a white lie. It is full of statements promoting peace and inclusion. Whether you agree or not, this cannot be separated from the content of the Quran itself.
I don't think this idea is true: since the 9/11 attacks were committed by al Qaeda extremists it doesn't seem fair to blame Jews.
This is not true at all. First of all, immigrants buy American products, which helps create jobs. Then they often start new businesses, and these business are more likely to hire employees than companies owned by native-born citizens. Last but not least, states with large numbers of immigrants report lower unemployment rates, so they give a net contribution to our country.
The far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.
why are you attacking muslim people who do not have to be here, because they are considered human.
In Western society men and women are supposed to be equal. Feminism is just an attempt to improve the issues of women and to end the gender equality gap.
Feminists promote equality, and I don't see how equality between men and women would be called a 'problem'. Why do you?
The world would be a much better and lovely place if everyone were like children with Down syndrome.
Are you suggesting to commit a crime? There are courts for punishment and if the crowd does the punishment itself, you will become criminals.
this is not true. i do you know it its power to support the root of the violent community?
The Koran does not condone sexual molester behavior, and if the Koran were to be read, it is clear that it was intended as a guide for its believers.
If you hate someone because of their religion, you should be ashamed of your hate. We should all be proud of our humanity.
No. A faith of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life helps make up humanity.
There's lots of evidence that the holocaust happened, survivors, concentration camps, documents, millions of lives ended. How can you say it never happened when there's so much evidence to show that it did?
The ones who deserved to be punished, were punished. If others are innocent, clearly they do not deserve to be penalized?
not all black people are criminals. black people are close to us, their children out of them. but would i have such cases when this isn't not.
Think you are digging yourself into a bit of a hole there.
Surely tolerance and understanding should exist across the world in all communities?
But that does not at all undermine their contribution to public good and society, his allegiance is his own business.
The majority of sexual assaults are committed by a family member, friend, or partner of the victim, and only 12% of convicted rapists are Muslim. It is not the religion, its the individuals, whether they're Muslim or not.
Gay people are not a danger to children, unless they are being abused. Please do not make such a statement.
Many pupils with learning difficulties attend school. This does not prove that others would prefer to attend school if people with difficulties were excluded from the education system.
The Koran does not condone sexual molester behavior, and if the Koran were to be read, it is clear that it was intended as a guide for its believers.
personally, i understand this country we show is the opposite.
islam is a religion that promotes tolerance and discrimination.
in fact, we are part of our society and should should be banned.
Limiting donors to such an extent (i.e. by excluding all gay people) would limit the amount of available blood and potentially lead to shortages.
Everyone has to follow British laws, that's just how it is. So yes, Muslim people do respect our laws. I haven't seen anyone breaking the law and then getting away with it.
The far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.
Muslims contribute a lot to our society. What are you contributing other than intolerance?
where did you get the information from? if you should get <unk> next source, and have all last time.
Many survivors confessed that they were willing to provide their children with stories of the Holocaust but it was very difficult emotionally. They want to talk about the aspects of life for Jews during the time of the Holocaust to not forget what happened.
In many Western societies there are Muslim, and these societies are in many ways more democratic than religiously homogeneous ones. Muslims are not incompatible with Western societies.
This is not true. Rape and torture of women and children is forbidden by the Qur'an.
This is just a canard that evolved from the “The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion”. This proven forgery was written by agents of the Russian czar in the late 19th century and claims to be the minutes of a secret meeting of Jewish leaders where they discuss a plan to rule the world. This canard spread throughout the centuries and continues to this day to promote the stereotype that the Jews own the banks and control the media and the government.
That is not the case, tuberculosis is a global health problem. Immigrants do not bring diseases, and if they do, the solution is to treat them.
Every person is a potential terrorist. What is your point?
Women are human, and as such they are capable of feeling emotions and being sensitive and caring for others, without being childlike.
Why wouldn't we? Maybe you should ask yourself if you really want to live in a country that isn't peaceful and tolerant towards everyone.
Gay people are already normal, they are just attracted to people of the same gender.
People of colour have the right to be treated with respect and dignity, and not taking into account stereotypes about their sexual life.
In Islam, like in all religions and groups, the problem of rape is more about the individual rather than the religion. In fact, statistics show that rape has the same rate in all ethnic and religious groups.
what do you mean by that? i do not want to understand islam and i look like you?
A school is a safe space and is an important part of any children's education. Everyone should be able to go to school.
Why do you think it is because of Muslims? To me, globalization and tourism would explain more why Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs'.
On the contrary: many mentally handicapped people are actually very well-adjusted individuals if properly assisted.
british migrants come here to work and pay taxes. we should need to stop <unk>
The Bible, the Quran and the Torah are very very similar in their teachings; if Muslims are incompatible then we must ask ourselves which religions are compatible?
feminism is about equality. but about having feminist equality is about equality.
we do not accept them in an way.
My friend, like Quran, many ancient literatures in many cultures and religions are still worth reading. For example, The Bible and The Buddhist scriptures are read by all the world and translated to many languages.
The same can be said for any race, religion, ethnicity, or national identity. We should not be afraid of differences, but we should strive for equal opportunity.
So all the Muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. In our country are in fact unemployed? How do they pull that off!
African people are able to feel pain like any other person. We should respect their bodies like ours.
where did you come to? i do not get any evidence for this?
But it’s just so adorable when they do it though, and their little outfits are so cute! It's just playing dress up for them, nothing wrong with them celebrating in a fun parade.
You are wrong about that. Blacks are genetically similar to us, and this does not make them inferior.
islam promotes violence, and consent, not an ideology and conquest.
A terrorist is someone who uses a religion as a tool for violent ends. To suggest that all Muslims are terrorists is just wrong.
Why do you call Pakistan a disgusting country? It has its culture and values. We cannot say that every Pakistani person is a rapist. Thus, you should not insult all the Pakistani people.
Islam is a religion, no one is forcing anyone to believe in it. It's not a sickness or a cancer.
this is not true. homosexuality has nothing used to justify us for women and women.
The charge that Jews are born greedy arises from medieval stereotypes and has nothing to do with the actual financial practices of Jews.
Although Jews have often been criticized for an alleged secret conspiracy, Jews are, in fact, a diverse and inclusive people, and the notion of a conspiracy of this kind is entirely without merit.
feminism is about equal rights. women are women, just as equal rights for men rights.
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
How about this: there are many people from other countries here, but they are not a 'burden', rather they are 'citizens'.
The vast majority of Muslims living in the UK are proud to call it home. Why should you break this integration process?
Or maybe appeasement to Muslims is just tolerance and understanding. Give that a try!
gay people should not feel comfortable in a different person. why exactly are they want others to be given the same because of nature as as part of new way of life.
Doesn't this just show that you're in favour of division? Women have their place in this society just as men do.
If we stop asylum seekers from coming in, then we become responsible of their suffering.
When they refused to serve you just what was it you were saying or doing in the minutes before? Why do I feel there is a fuller story here?
Fat people are not the ones responsible for your suffering and lack of access to basic healthcare services.
Why do you call Pakistan a disgusting country? It has its culture and values. We cannot say that every Pakistani person is a rapist. Thus, you should not insult all the Pakistani people.
Instead of dividing us up and ruining us all, let's work together to solve the problems that we all face.
Migrants and refugees are welcome in our country, why should we stop them?
Muslims are not a problem to me. What do you think makes them problematic?
WIthout softeness and emotions there would just be brutality and cruelty. Not all women are soft and emotional and many men have these characteristics. To perpetuate these socially constructed gender profiles maintains patriarchal norms which oppress both men and women.
Islam is about acceptance, not a death cult. In your opinion, what makes it criminal?
Actually, not all Muslims are incompatible with Western societies. Many Muslims have lived in our societies for many years without any problem.
Do you really think so? The reason why we have inequality in the first place is because of the oppression of some people by others.
There are different skin tones, so there is no such thing as a race.
The notion that Jews are trying to subvert our government is completely unfounded. I honestly do not see the link between being Jews and trying to subvert our government.
Peace, tolerance, unity, community, cooperation, being neighbourly, are they mental illness too?
Migrants do not receive 35 euros per se, this money is paid to the co-ops to cover food and accommodation during the period spent in first aid facilities
Many Gypsies have regular jobs, but we do not know, because they don't need to tell.
You cannot be racist towards an ideology. You can, however, be discriminatory and intolerant towards the people that follow it.
Being the chosen people does not mean that Jews have greater privileges than others or that they are better than others. Rather, according to Jewish law, it means that they have a special duty to uphold Jewish ethical teachings.
Death cults are generally not successful at attracting new followers. It is not true that Islam is a religion of death.
refugees are welcome. migrants deserve our rights they deserve respect.
This is demonstrably false. Radical Christian terrorism has been behind countless attacks. Terrorism can come from any group and the only thing all terrorism has in common is that it is abhorrent.
islam is a religion, and integration, and tolerance is a false religion.
Are you forced to pray in a Mosque? Or observe all the rules? As far as I see it, Muslims follow their traditions, that is their right, but they do not convert anyone in our society.
Migrants are not a burden to our country. Migrants have been proven to be contributing members of society.
If I say it and find one or two online references does that make it true? What if I write: 'The vast majority of Islamophobes are unemployed and refuse to work.' ?
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
Hollywood is an extremely diverse industry, and Jews are a small but vocal minority of actors, directors, producers, etc. How can you say that Jews control the Hollywood industry?
Most immigrants are here legally and work for their families. It is necessary to accept people from every country instead of leaving out people in need because of their nationality.
"There are many Muslims living in places such as Islington, a London suburb, where there is a ""trendy area"" that has less crime and good schools."
A woman has every right to her own body, and she should be allowed to make her own decisions.
A much bigger threat to our diverse, tolerant western civilisation is hatred generalised to entire religions.
We are not accepting this. These people are being rightly punished for their actions. But my question is, what is the point of bringing up the religion? Do you really think this is the cause of the problem?
The Quran does not mention FGM and it is carried out by Christians as well as Muslims. The fact that her parents are Muslim has no bearing on the risk factor.
There are many black people who want to work. Do you have any proof that they do not want to work?
The West has always been about freedom, democracy and the rule of law. Freedom and democracy are things that can be achieved only by a multiethnic, pluralistic, civilised society.
No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!
islam is simply about peace and tolerance and intolerance.
Dear friend, first of all, sharia law and Islam are not extreme. Sharia law is guidance for the goal of leading humanity close to God and to live in kindness and justice with God's creation. Second of all, jihad, based on the concept of Muslim, means struggle for the advancement of oneself within the guidelines of Islam. All these reveal that Islam is a peaceful religion.
Why should we restrict women's rights? We should respect their rights as well.
Anyone who says that the major problem in the UK is with Muslim rape gangs is either intentionally lying or trying to deflect attention from the problem of violence against women.
Homosexuals are not sick, but they might have a mental health crisis because of prejudice. Being isolated from society can only worsen the situation.
Double standards all round lots of British culture and Christian faiths oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures from #equalpay #metoo #timesup job restrictions in the church to condoning/ hiding sexual violence and child exploitation #thetruthproject.
What do you mean by 'mental illness'? A person's feelings are their own thoughts, not a disease.
My opinion is that black people are just like us even if they have a different skin color, but I don't think they are inherently worse than us.
No child is 'forced fed' Islam. Parents retain the right to take their child out of any religious education.
A crime is a crime, regardless of who commits it. Rape is always to be condemned, but it is important not to use it as a gimmick to target a particular group. Women should not be used as an excuse for this.
Not all rapists are black and not all black are rapists. Skin color doesn't make you a criminal.
Actually, not all Muslims are incompatible with Western societies. Many Muslims have lived in our societies for many years without any problem.
we are allowed to ban lgbt people as a social community, and we cannot take up the benefits to have legal right to choose.
Gay people are not a danger to children, unless they are being abused. Please do not make such a statement.
This is just a canard that evolved from the “The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion”. This proven forgery was written by agents of the Russian czar in the late 19th century and claims to be the minutes of a secret meeting of Jewish leaders where they discuss a plan to rule the world. This canard spread throughout the centuries and continues to this day to promote the stereotype that the Jews own the banks and control the media and the government.
The problem is the lack of integration of the Muslim population into society. The integration is necessary, the problem is that there are still no laws to foster a solution.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Muslims contribute a lot to our society. What are you contributing other than intolerance?
There is no need to ban gays from Europe and US. It is simply not appropriate to treat gays like this.
There are lots of different races, and someone can't be judged as inferior just by skin color.
"Actually there are also some Jews that hate other jews: ""I belonged to Europe, to Germany, and I thanked my creator that I was German"" - Victor Klemperer speaking of his experience in WW1, explaining his dislike of Russian Jews... Do you feel better now that we proved that Jews hate everybody? #sarcasm"
can you provide up positive conclusions of terror and crisis?
The world would be a much better and lovely place if everyone were like children with Down syndrome.
Immigration is good for our economy, and the very opposite of 'the death' to us.
"This is not true. Let me cite a verse in Quran for you. ""muslims cannot preemptively initiate a war."" [quote from Quran about peace]."
No one is stopping you from celebrating Easter, nor are they offended by it.
I think you will find race hate started by the English when we first set foot overseas, Crusade anyone?
Hollywood is an extremely diverse industry, and Jews are a small but vocal minority of actors, directors, producers, etc. How can you say that Jews control the Hollywood industry?
rape is always a criminal act. it is not be your problem. we need to look at this word child abuse.
You're completely ignoring the distinction between sex and gender. People of the female sex have a female reproductive system, but gender is about how you feel, how you identify, gender has nothing to do with your reproductive organs.
Refugee crisis in our country is a burden to our society.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Because of institutionalised racism in the Police, meaning they are more likely to get stopped and searched, randomly targeted, or assumed to be doing something 'suspicious'. Also because of the type of crimes the Police focus energy on e.g. street crimes that happen in poorer areas, which black people are more likely to live in, are given more Police attention than white collar crime.
Crime and criminals are not dependent on any culture. Christian criminals are also not held by religious events. It is just not correct to align religion and criminality.
Being gay is not a choice. Gay people shouldn't have to hide their sexuality in order to be accepted.
If I say it and find one or two online references does that make it true? What if I write: 'The vast majority of Islamophobes are unemployed and refuse to work.' ?
Jews are people too, regardless of religion, and they are welcome here, as anyone is allowed to be a part of our society.
This is not true. Rape and torture of women and children is forbidden by the Qur'an.
Islam is a religion that promotes love and compassion.
religions cannot use violence and violence against violence.
so you're saying that you are repeating the idea that women have been controlling women's rights. is exactly is the relation between people and their sexual orientation that is wrong.
Islam is really about peace unification and peace to the world, not about bloodshed and troubles.
Jews were not obsessed with the holocaust. The murder of some 6 millions Jews by the Nazis shocked the world. Most of the survivors were only killed because they were suspected of belonging to a particular community. The Jewish people suffered greatly as a result of persecution, and the holocaust should be remembered not to let this happen again.
What, you mean the people who spend their lives reading, learning and practicing Islam do not know what its really about?
Islam is a religion of peace. It is a religion of tolerance. To promote violence and hatred is not the faith of peace.
Actually, not all Muslims are incompatible with Western societies. Many Muslims have lived in our societies for many years without any problem.
I don't think it's necessary to create a new world , just a less violent one and mass genocide wouldn't help with that.
By your logic, the world will be diverse so long as Islam isn't practiced in Antactica?
Muslims contribute a lot to our society. What are you contributing other than intolerance?
We accept gay, lesbian and trans people because God's laws are on our side.
there is no proof that every person is talking there.
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
"People with Down syndrome, when supported by colleagues receive a fundamental boost to their productivity? This ""mix"" also fosters a positive working atmosphere and increases engagement and attention in all workers."
Women are just as capable of feeling emotions as men, and men can likewise be just as empathic.
gay people have never been punished as anyone else. what is in gay history, this minority against people.
Even if some immigrants don't pay taxes to the state, that doesn't mean that all of them should not have a say in the country. Simply because some British citizens don't pay taxes, this doesn't mean that no-one should have a say in our country. Be careful with generalization: what goes around comes around.
Muslims have been part of Western society for centuries and centuries, they helped shape and design Western society- to say they are incompatible is a complete incongruity.
we need to deport all people fleeing their countries because they are coming because of their countries.
Or have we been coexisting and you are now suddenly offended by people being different from you?
Refugees fleeing wars and poverty are not willing to fail Europe. They are fleeing persecution, and that is why they are fleeing.
Gays are not animals. Why you should isolate people based on their sexual preferences?
Jews were not obsessed with the holocaust. The murder of some 6 millions Jews by the Nazis shocked the world. Most of the survivors were only killed because they were suspected of belonging to a particular community. The Jewish people suffered greatly as a result of persecution, and the holocaust should be remembered not to let this happen again.
You could say that about any person, Muslim or not. According to the government, far right extremism is a bigger terrorist threat than Muslims. Does that make you a potential terrorist?
you are right: you find a form of torture? whatever you hate hate against others?
Migrants are not a burden to our country. Migrants have been proven to be contributing members of society.
It's not true that the LGBT community is a drain on society. The LGBT community makes a major and positive contribition to our society. I just don't see how this is detrimental.
Migrants do not receive much by the government, and asylum support benefits are much less than universal credit for UK citizens. Besides, migrants are put in hotel rooms only temporarily while they are processing their asylum applications.
After world war 2 European governments recruited Muslims to rebuild Europe. There would not be a civilised Europe without Muslims.
Why should we restrict women's rights? We should respect their rights as well.
"I don't claim they are ""in need of special treatment."" On the contrary, they just need understanding, and we are very lucky to have an amazing, diverse human society around us."
Gays are not disgusting pricks. They are just like any other person.
What if knickers don't suit them? What if they don't obey? Would it be a problem?
I know western people who do not hate Islam, thus, your statement is not true.
Being forced to eat my peas when I was a kid just made me hate them even more. Still cannot stomach the damn things.
"The principle of ""equality before the law"" does not mean that everyone has obtained equal rights. So, it's very logical to demand equality when there are inequalities."
Most of the people who migrate to the UK come here to work.
Islam is about acceptance, not a death cult. In your opinion, what makes it criminal?
That's not true. Children only require to be raised by loving parents, and lesbians can be that.
islam is a religion that promotes tolerance and discrimination.
Gay people are a danger to children only if they abuse them, which isn't the case. Yours is a generalization.
A definition of Judaism based on physical or genetic traits is misleading because Jews appear throughout the world. Jews resemble their non-Jewish neighbors in the countries from which they originate.
Do you really think that Jews are a hindrance to a peaceful society? Maybe the problem is racism and antisemitism.
There are still plenty of caring women who want to be mothers. Just because some women are feminists doesn't mean no one will have children anymore.
100% of the unemployed Muslim stats I read on Twitter are fake. Muslim unemployment is at 12% in the UK, and many of that number are actively seeking work.
islam is simply about peace and tolerance and intolerance.
Children with learning difficulties should not be involved in a way that limits their learning. As for the other children, their values should be enhanced.
Gays are not disgusting pricks. They are just like any other person.
Are you accusing all the Britain Muslims of antisemitism? I disagree, from my experience they are just usual people who do not show their hate towards anybody, they just live their lives.
We must not confuse Islam with a religion of hate.
I don't think black people are inherently worse or better than us, they just have a different skin color. They're the same as us in all other respects.
Had lunch with some Muslim friends recently. Somehow, I am still HIV and Ebola free!
When they refused to serve you just what was it you were saying or doing in the minutes before? Why do I feel there is a fuller story here?
Actually, not all Muslims are incompatible with Western societies. Many Muslims have lived in our societies for many years without any problem.
A woman has every right to her own body, and she should be allowed to make her own decisions.
actually, all women men want to be even with the one don’t do with many men and people want. they want to be happy.
Not all Muslims are from the Middle East, like not all Muslims are from Pakistan. And to equate all Muslims with extremists is misleading.
Man spreads Hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? And they want to continue this filth?
I'd suggest a walk down West London where areas like St John's Wood are very affluent with mostly white people living there.
Education is about development and learning, so if disadvantaged people are excluded, then the education system would be about learning exclusion and discrimination.
Being gay is not a choice. Gay people shouldn't have to hide their sexuality in order to be accepted.
"The statement ""all white people are bad"" is not a fair statement. Many whites are 'good' and some are 'racist' because they think that being white is a mark of superiority."
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Muslims contribute a lot to our society. What are you contributing other than intolerance?
Not all black people are bad. Not all black people are criminals. Not all black people are violent. Being aware that there are people different from you is a good thing.
So you are suggesting Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the Sudan oppress women, but somehow you know better than every white woman who is a Muslim and feel entitled to make public judgements about them. See what I am getting at?
You are wrong about that. Blacks are genetically similar to us, and this does not make them inferior.
"Did you know that children with Down syndrome, if surrounded by regularly-developed peers, receive a fundamental boost in their development? This ""mix"" fosters a positive learning atmosphere and increases engagement and attention in all students. This mean that children with Down syndrome would be a burden to society if isolated, not the contrary."
The idea that Jews are supposed to run the world is completely baseless. Since the dawn of time, there have been Jewish leaders in business and politics, exaclty like Christians and Muslim ones.
Well most Muslims are here because of our 'civilised' crusades, 'civilised' industrial scale slavery, and 'civilised' pillaging of natural resources and yet the vast majority of Muslims in the UK are proud to be British, work hard and and contribute to the economy.
We welcome and respect the wishes of the people fleeing from wars in the Middle East and Africa.
It sounds like you're demonizing black people in a racist way. Black people are born same as us, and they can grow up to be respectable people or not, like anyone else.
There is no 'them and us' we all must live together in respect, peace and understanding.
Despite the local press blaming all Muslims, of course, there is no evidence that Muslims are more prone to crime than the general population. The main problem is poverty, and often mental illness and addiction, rather than a single faith.
lgbt rights should be allowed to have their lives too, should you be happy to be accepted.
many countries have welcomed innovators on our world, equality is the result of the rights of women rights for women as well.
Using intolerance and discrimination against anyone different? Sounds like a western issue.
I am sure Islam has many followers who are good people who are just living their faith. The abuse of power is something that is not specific to followers of any particular faith.
Jewish survivors of the Holocaust, whose suffering is nothing to be ashamed of, are proof that violence is never right.
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
If the mother is an independent woman thanks to feminism, it can only be good for the family.
I think you will find race hate started by the English when we first set foot overseas, Crusade anyone?
actually, when? they follow sharia law and the law proves the law of sharia law i their question is:
It is the right of every citizen to have a fair and open society. Migrants have the right to live here.
Learning about gender identity and sexual orientation in health classes in school could promote a more accepting environment and reduce bullying.
Through integration we show hospitality and acceptance towards several groups of people. It's good for both our people and the country to live in a diverse society.
Where did you get this information from? I do not believe any crime would be free from judge. We should have more failth in English laws and people who execute the laws.
Surely tolerance and understanding should exist across the world in all communities?
refugees are not their borders, and immigration are welcome here in our country. why should we stop them?
gay people are more denied women's rights especially like the police have the same rights as men. how can you be possible?
Jewish folk are just a collection of people with different backgrounds. Some of them work in Hollywood, but that's all.
Because Victorian girls and women were treated equally with respect? That was when there no Muslims in the country. Are we really much better now? #metoo?
For someone who is dating to find love, for no reason at all would I find this to be questionable.
Immigrants come to this country legally, just as many European citizens do. They have every right to stay in this country, and to return home if they wish to.
actually, when? they follow sharia law and the law proves the law of sharia law i their question is:
There are many Muslims and mosques in the UK. They have every right to be here.
Islam is a peaceful religion and has never caused trouble in our country.
The Jews are not the problem in the world. And the Jews have the right to be proud of their history.
They're not all that annoying. Gay men are normal guys who find love and/or sex with someone of their own sex.
A woman has every right to her own body, and she should be allowed to make her own decisions.
Refugees fleeing wars and poverty are not willing to fail Europe. They are fleeing persecution, and that is why they are fleeing.
Why do you think it is a crime to be gay? It is a societal disorder to target gays.
Please also notice that huge numbers of girls and children experience domestic sexual abuse by a partner or family member. Girls and children are vulnerable. We should encourage people to help victims and prevent sexual crimes.
gay people exist, just is a myth. heterosexual people are just a human right. just as we respect the right to reform.
immigrants are not welcome in this country, and they do not want that control in society.
Why should we restrict women's rights? We should respect their rights as well.
The Koran does not condone sexual molester behavior, and if the Koran were to be read, it is clear that it was intended as a guide for its believers.
Feminism is a social movement that claims equality, it's so far from oppressing men.
We are taking in refugees. And refugees are welcome.
Does this mean they have no identity or no value at all?
Feminism is about the equality of the sexes, and many women use feminism as a mean to achieve their legitimate goals. Through equality they can get to the opportunities that otherwise won't be accessible to them.
Everyone is allowed to their own opinion, but also to their own beliefs and religion.
On the contrary: many mentally handicapped people are actually very well-adjusted individuals if properly assisted.
i do not understand why you can apply your position? if you want to have your consent?
You could say that about any person, Muslim or not. According to the government, far right extremism is a bigger terrorist threat than Muslims. Does that make you a potential terrorist?
Surely people born in Muslim countries should have the same opportunities as those from non-Muslim countries?
women are human beings like full less human beings, and deserve respect.
Are you calling for the total extermination of the black population? Do you know that what you suggest is completely illegal and hate crime?
There are men in love with men too. Some people are heterosexual, and other homosexual. What you are saying is that loving men is not the same as loving women. Still, both are forms of love.
gay people are not a danger to society, unless they are protected as vulnerable like any citizen.
refugees are not their borders, and immigration are welcome here in our country. why should we stop them?
Because they are a minority, Jews might feel different and sometimes they may be misconstrued because of their cultural and religious differences, but they are all human beings
even if migrants controlled the financial financial world, academia, and the whole solar stereotype. how can you mean they control the right to this?
refugees are welcome. migrants deserve our rights they deserve respect.
Where did you get this information from? I do not believe any crime would be free from judge. We should have more failth in English laws and people who execute the laws.
Immigrants may be able to work legally, provided that they are given the opportunity to do so.
There are plenty of bisexuals in the world, it's actually very common to be bisexual. What is not normal about that?
If you dislike diversity so much, why do not you go off and live in a country where there are no Muslims, only people like you?
yes, i am sure how many values you have. women who pose equal rights in dignity to be treated as if they want.
Cearly this is not a way to catch a disease is it?
Improvements in testing and other safeguards have reduced the risk from transfusion transmitted HIV, so ruling out donors only because of their sexual orientation is completely meaningless.
Blacks are individuals with different backgrounds, and this has nothing to do with being criminal.
Gays are not disgusting pricks. They are just like any other person.
The Quran is a book about religious teachings, I don't see how it would promote discrimination. Do you have a reference for this claim?
Maybe you should consider that not all women are childlike, and that some women are 'childlike' with children!
You might be right that some immigrants are lawbreakers, but that does not mean that all immigrants are criminal and terrorists.
Muslims contribute a lot to our society. What are you contributing other than intolerance?
i think it is myth that we are invaded from many over the world. they have been part of our history and history.
Muslims have contributed greatly to our society, and I do not see how they are 'common criminals'.
Muslims in Britain have contributed a lot to our economy. They are true innovators in modern Britain.
Even if they follow the sharia law, Muslims don't want to 'take over' but rather to live alongside everyone else
The shockingly low number of rape convictions in the UK shows not enough counteraction from the police and gov in rape cases generally, of which the vast majority are not committed by Muslims.
In their country they lived in houses, they are nomads by necessity because people historically persecuted them.
The strength that black people display is the strength of all people. Black people are just different in that they don't have any social advantage. We must reflect on this.
actions of any difference can use a disproportionate amount of violence among islam islam muslims. not only any religious group.
No one is forcing kids to transition, if a child feels like they are transgender then actually being able to medically transition with hormones is not a decision ever taken lightly, and it's a long and stressful process involving consultation from many medical and psychological professionals.
There has always been migrant skilled labour migration into the UK, we have even contributed inviting asian and caribbean worker after WW2 to fill skills gaps. Migration isn't new, how it is being shown in the media has changed in order to cause a panic among people about high levels of migration.
No, an entire faith did not invent the slave trade.
Jews were not obsessed with the holocaust. The murder of some 6 millions Jews by the Nazis shocked the world. Most of the survivors were only killed because they were suspected of belonging to a particular community. The Jewish people suffered greatly as a result of persecution, and the holocaust should be remembered not to let this happen again.
If women are not allowed to vote, then women are not worthy of respect and equal rights, and this is in conflict with the principles of democracy.
Homosexuals are not sick, but they might have a mental health crisis because of prejudice. Being isolated from society can only worsen the situation.
rape is always a criminal act. it is not be your problem. we need to look at this word child abuse.
islam is an ideology and hate promoting violent ancient crime and crimes. people. why exactly do you say that?
Every person is a potential terrorist. What is your point?
we should stop violence by poverty when we claim them to do work,
Although there are definitely differences between men and women, they don't imply that women are less than men, or deserve inferior treatment.
Rape is always a crime, whether a man or a woman is the victim. Rape is a crime regardless of gender. But male-on-female rape is prevailing by far.
actually, all women men want to be even with the one don’t do with many men and people want. they want to be happy.
Not all Muslims are from the Middle East, like not all Muslims are from Pakistan. And to equate all Muslims with extremists is misleading.
Unfortunately, you are not the only one that hates homosexuals. But I would hate to think that we live in a country where it is acceptable to practice such hate.
rape is always a criminal act. it is not be your problem. we need to look at this word child abuse.
"What do you mean ""nothing"" to our society? Muslims have contributed a lot to our society, including art, science, literature, our infrastructure and healthcare system."
History shows that all races were created equal. Therefore, all humans are created equal.
"If we considered foreigners to be ""troublemakers"" then we should probably be less welcoming, but it seems we are still not willing to give up our ""standard of living"" that requires migrants to be here."
this is not true. muslims can can come to violence and 'morally but in this has something as a notion of innocent how they do not believe in western religious inequalities are about this kind of it.
Associating AIDS and HIV with homosexuals is just a prejudice driven by fear. Even if this disease may be more common among gay people, that does not mean that all homosexuals are likely to have AIDS. Not all homosexuals are promiscuously fornicating with strangers, as you said. Most people check their partners, more so as gay men.
Muslims contribute a lot to our society. What are you contributing other than intolerance?
To claim that Islam is not peaceful is without foundation. According to the Quran, Islam is a peaceful religion. If you want to understand what is really going on with the world, then you should study the Quran, not spout hate speech.
Muslims contribute a lot to our society. What are you contributing other than intolerance?
Coeducation can involve teaching the classmates of children with Down Syndrome to be responsible. As children are often better at approaching children with disabilities than adults, their involvement can be therapeutic, without adding any costs.
Rapists will use any excuse to justify their actions. This is an abhorrent individual.
Why do you think it is because of Muslims? To me, globalization and tourism would explain more why Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs'.
Children are being taught Islam as much as they're being taught about all the other religions. I hardly think this counts as indoctrination.
are you sure? including muslim muslim emmigrants i does not have to be fine.
Gays are not animals. Why you should isolate people based on their sexual preferences?
A lot of immigrants feel insecure and unsafe in their own country, if we want to make our country better, we need to make sure everyone, immigrant or not, feels safe and protected.
All women are human beings. The problem arises when women are taught that they are subhuman.
Of course they do! And also the Moon, Mars and all the solar system.
Women are neither childlike nor soft and emotional. They feel emotions as part of who they are and their human nature.
Islam - Silence is tacit acceptance. Raise your voice against Islamophobia!
A school is a safe space and is an important part of any children's education. Everyone should be able to go to school.
Laws and policies are usually necessary for the progress of society. Governments often create laws and policies to stop crime, protect against poverty, protect the environment, etc. Protecting minorities is no exception.
Black don't commit more crimes, but even if they did, this wouldn't make them inherently worse than whites. The statistics are affected by other factors than race.
are you saying that all black people are born in other men's and some are less than a danger for us?
Women are not a burden to society. They are human beings with equal rights.
Because Victorian girls and women were treated equally with respect? That was when there no Muslims in the country. Are we really much better now? #metoo?
No women should be relegated to this. It is about time we stop letting stereotypes rule our society.
Instead of dividing us up and ruining us all, let's work together to solve the problems that we all face.
i don't understand why you think that women should be told they're told for their rights as i don't have equality of rights.
Terrorism is a political ideology, and one that has no place in a modern democratic state, regardless of ethnicity.
Did you know that the crime rates are lower in states with higher immigration , and that states with larger shares of undocumented immigrants tend to have lower crime rates than states with smaller shares? It seems that, contrary to your claims immigrants bring law and order to the U.S.!
Violence on our streets is the result of many complex causes. Violence cannot simply be the fault of one race.
The Bible clearly says that everyone is equal in God's eyes.
People of colour have the right to be treated with respect and dignity, and not taking into account stereotypes about their sexual life.
While this story is presented as an 'Islamic issue', the OFSTED report refers to 'countless' faith schools still that still illegally maintain gender segregation - my guess is this is a cross-faith practice and not exclusive to Islamic faith schools.
Women tend to do the majority of housework while having a job outside as well. If by 'childlike' you mean having to be creative because of multitasking and managing their whole family, yes, otherwise, there is no doubt about the extra workload women are handling in the rigours of modern life.
There are criminals, who are from UK, raping children and murdering people. Maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes.
This was a prank planned by non-muslims on 4chan. Muslim do not mind if you take your dogs out for a walk. This blog post shows the thread it came from;
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
There are lots of different races, and someone can't be judged as inferior just by skin color.
Who has? Nobody has been at war with an entire faith for a thousand years.
The N-word is an insult that is still used to demean African Americans. It has nothing to do with political correctness.
do you know these muslims are just in the us too. so, do you think muslims are religious or terrorists.
So are you saying that Islam is not compatible with Western Civilization?
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
Feminism is a progressive ideology. As such, it is in the process of changing sexist ideas.
During the depression following the second world war, Muslims from across the world were invited to Britain to help combat austerity. It worked. They were invited because countries across the world had already been subjugated by the British Empire.
They are not a burden, they just want to work. How are they a burden to you?
Muslims who live here have at heart our country. I do not see any need to divide people who are fighting for the same cause.
Yes, we are allowed to celebrate Easter as Muslims are allowed to celebrate Ramadan. No one is offending anyone here, why tehre is a need to create division?
To use an old saying, you cannot be 'European' and be a 'racist'.
we should try to address the root causes of problems. but this was due to gender and racism in the black people is just a part.
Are you suggesting to commit a crime? There are courts for punishment and if the crowd does the punishment itself, you will become criminals.
That is just nonsense. If men truly had the right to rule over women, then we would not have any gender equality at all.
this is just true. feminism is not like equality, and it is a movement for equality, not hate.
Surely tolerance and understanding should exist across the world in all communities?
Small groups of people peacefully gather to pray, but because they do not look like you, you are outraged? Why am I not surprised?
Muslims have been part of Western society for centuries and centuries, they helped shape and design Western society- to say they are incompatible is a complete incongruity.
everyone has the right to fight for men and to be treated as men and have always done for that.
what do you mean? there is an influx of migrants are contributing to the economy. it is not about migrants, and we should welcome for them.
are you sure? including muslim muslim emmigrants i does not have to be fine.
But we all know that Islam is a religion of peace, just like Christianity.
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
Where did you get this information from? I do not believe any crime would be free from judge. We should have more failth in English laws and people who execute the laws.
Being gay is not a choice. Gay people shouldn't have to hide their sexuality in order to be accepted.
First of all, there are people in the US who have lawful status and who have chosen to live in the US. Second, most immigrants are naturalized citizens. Third, there is a lot of debate about 'legitimacy' since the values of citizenship and 'legitimacy' are very different for immigrants.
Jews are not controlling. Maybe you should try to understand that Jews are a group of regular people, and they are not all members of a secret intelligence.
This myth traces back to “The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion”, that is used as proof of a Jewish conspiracy to rule the world. But the Protocols are a proven forgery, written by agents of the Russian czar in the late 19th century, that spread throughout the 20th century and continues to this day.
Being Jewish doesn't make you any less of a human being. The fact that you are Jewish doesn't mean that you deserve less human rights.
have you ever ever spoken to a muslim?
Double standards all round lots of British culture and Christian faiths oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures from #equalpay #metoo #timesup job restrictions in the church to condoning/ hiding sexual violence and child exploitation #thetruthproject.
this is just a hatred. and equal feminism is to promote women and feminism, women to have the rights
Easter Eggs were always about children getting chocolate and very little about any religion.
we need to deport all people fleeing their countries because they are coming because of their countries.
women are human beings deserving of respect. even you saying so?
To claim that Islam is not peaceful is without foundation. According to the Quran, Islam is a peaceful religion. If you want to understand what is really going on with the world, then you should study the Quran, not spout hate speech.
Children should not do any of that with white men, or anyone they do not know or even ones they do know if it does not feel right. Suggesting only one group of men commit abuse leaves more children unsafe and vulnerable.
islam is a religion, not a death cult. if the other religion is. what do you choose with their own religion on peace, anyone does to things if they cannot exist to?
in fact, we are part of our society and should should be banned.
100% of the unemployed Muslim stats I read on Twitter are fake. Muslim unemployment is at 12% in the UK, and many of that number are actively seeking work.
Peace, tolerance, unity, community, cooperation, being neighbourly, are they mental illness too?
Bloody retribution? An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind!
There's absolutely no link between bisexuality and child marriage. What are you implying?
Please read this article written by a Rotherham grooming gang survivor https://ind.pn/2GHjGn7.
I am tired of seeing women being treated as sex objects. It's about time that women are given the respect they deserve.
Peace, tolerance, unity, community, cooperation, being neighbourly, are they mental illness too?
Gay men are not promiscuous. To suggest otherwise is to be grossly generalistic. How many gay men do you know?
gay people exist, just is a myth. heterosexual people are just a human right. just as we respect the right to reform.
A British dog born in a British stable is not a horse, but its still British. We have obligations both 'to' and 'for' our Citizen's, be they good or evil surely?
The Koran does not condone sexual molester behavior, and if the Koran were to be read, it is clear that it was intended as a guide for its believers.
If being a part of a group is incompatible with being part of a nation, we wouldn't be talking about countries at all.
Islam is a religion of peace. It is a religion of tolerance. To promote violence and hatred is not the faith of peace.
this is not true. homosexuality has nothing used to justify us for women and women.
Children are being taught Islam as much as they're being taught about all the other religions. I hardly think this counts as indoctrination.
islam is a religion of peace. muslims be very integrated part of our country, if we so like in it seems as an expert wouldn't let's i think by how is talking about inclusion and understanding of our community is not the <unk> for equal society. what is compatible with bad sex.
The feminist movement is a fight to end sexism, not a fight to dominate men.
These incidents must be reported to the police, of course, but we should focus on the rape, not who's doing it.
You are not saying that Islam is not a religion of peace, are you?
Feminism is an ideology and movement promoting empowerment of women. It is about equality, and not the degradation of men.
The reason why a woman does not want to reproduce might be because she is happy just as she is.
That's not true, Islam is not that different from other faiths I know: it does as well promote peace and inclusion. Many of its beliefs and practices are totally compatible with Western culture.
We should be very careful of what we assume. We shouldn't go scaremongering without proof.
Or maybe appeasement to Muslims is just tolerance and understanding. Give that a try!
Why do you think it is because of Muslims? To me, globalization and tourism would explain more why Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs'.

Jews are not in charge of the media or the government. At least not in the United States of America.
Immigration doesn't mean letting people in to steal our jobs, but rather, respecting people's right to live and work in the country they choose.
Is it facts or just your imagination? I do not agree that they aim to take control of us. Maybe they are trying to build their society inside our country, but you are hypothesizing too much,.
So all the Muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. In our country are in fact unemployed? How do they pull that off!
I'm sorry to hear you don't feel safe in your local area anymore but what does migrants moving to the area have to do with that?
After world war 2 European governments recruited Muslims to rebuild Europe. There would not be a civilised Europe without Muslims.
The only ones in favour of posts like this are the ones that that are ignorant about what they truly mean.
women are not weak. for women are laws and women suffer based on their emotions and rights,
The media are full of the rumours of rape and abuse committed by Muslim. The problem is not about Islam. It is about violence.
women are also therefore that opinions, and do about their emotions with respect. they are very respected as such.
They have to come here to be able to claim asylum at all, you have to be on UK soil to make a claim. It's not illegal to go to a country to claim asylum.
Is it because they speak their native language better than English? Don't you think there is something more to the story?
Actually, not all Muslims are incompatible with Western societies. Many Muslims have lived in our societies for many years without any problem.
"migrants come here to work and family and they take care of their lives. not.
people should have a danger to society, especially in the society with some us thinking on.
Western Society seems pretty incompatible with Western Society or any other at the moment, maybe we could learn something from Indonesia, which has been conflict free since 2005.
Fat people are not the ones responsible for your suffering and lack of access to basic healthcare services.
many immigrants come here for young people, and we have a better skills for their needs.
Women should be allowed to vote and to have equal rights, as it is stated in the Constitution.
Nonbinary people can partially identify as either male or female, or as neither male nor female. Therefore, it seems the terminology is fitting, and that they exist: why don't you accept that?
women are not only men and they are less rational or men. why should it be theirs?
Jews are not controlling. Maybe you should try to understand that Jews are a group of regular people, and they are not all members of a secret intelligence.
Actually all modern science and mathematics are children of Islam.
Muslims make up a very important part of our country and its people. They are our neighbours, our friends. They are our brothers and sisters. They are our future. They are our future Britain.
Islam is a religion, and to suggest that Islam is incompatible with civilisation is just scaremongering.
The far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.
Where did you get this information from? I do not believe any crime would be free from judge. We should have more failth in English laws and people who execute the laws.
The West has always been about freedom, democracy and the rule of law. Freedom and democracy are things that can be achieved only by a multiethnic, pluralistic, civilised society.
(Do an image search for the image used, try to find it is source. Either you can demonstrate that the image has been misappropriated or you can talk about how individuals have always used religion to justify their actions, the problem is with the individual not the religion.)
Gays are not a disease. Homosexuality is a sexual orientation.
This was a prank planned by non-muslims on 4chan. Muslim do not mind if you take your dogs out for a walk. This blog post shows the thread it came from;
We will not know until the next census by recent survey suggest that the UK is increasingly a secular society with a growing percentage expressing no religous affiliation at all.
The number of illegal immigrants entering the US has actually more than halved in the last 20 years. To make your point that migrants are all criminals is just plain wrong.
For each historical period there is something Jews are accused of. Today, someone can even claim that Jews are responsible for the alien invasion!
Gay marriage is not a way to bring back slavery. LGBT+ people exist, and they should be respected.
Child rapes are not only convicted by muslims. In fact, around 90% of the sexual abuse are convicted by person known to the child. This is a sad truth. We should help children be free from sexual abuse and rape.
women are human beings with equal rights. we should be equal rights.
The Jewish community is Jewish is not controlling, it doesn't make sense for them to be, unless you mean that they are controlling because they vote and participate in society, which every citizen in the country does.
400 Jews died in September 11 terrorist attacks, so not one of the smartest plan I ever saw!
Are you seriously suggesting that we solve all the ills that plagues our society by not teaching our children about the bad in the past, and about the good in the present? This can end up hurting our children.
The Quran does not mention FGM and it is carried out by Christians as well as Muslims. The fact that her parents are Muslim has no bearing on the risk factor.
Why do you call Pakistan a disgusting country? It has its culture and values. We cannot say that every Pakistani person is a rapist. Thus, you should not insult all the Pakistani people.
We still can teach British, European and World history, but part of that is looking at the history of groups which have been erased from our history previously. Looking at the some of the historic struggles of LGBT people in the UK can inform the future for everyone!
Does that mean Jews as a 2,5% minority can control all levels of government? In a democratic country, we believe that every minority should be represented in the government and it guarantees that noone has total control over anything.
Women like that are not unfeminine or bitchy. They just might want to do something else other than housework and taking care of kids.
as a matter of fact, people aren't a threat just because of their skin colour.
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
Who has? Nobody has been at war with an entire faith for a thousand years.
Islam is not a terrorist organization. Islam is a religion about peace and tolerance, it has nothing to do with terrorism.
Peace, tolerance, unity, community, cooperation, being neighbourly, are they mental illness too?
Well, of course women can cause problems, but so can men. It seems to me that you're confused.
Perhaps we should have a look at what women have to say about this topic rather than perpetuating sexist stereotypes.
This is just a canard that evolved from the “The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion”. This proven forgery was written by agents of the Russian czar in the late 19th century and claims to be the minutes of a secret meeting of Jewish leaders where they discuss a plan to rule the world. This canard spread throughout the centuries and continues to this day to promote the stereotype that the Jews own the banks and control the media and the government.
AIDS is transmitted by unprotected sexual activity and anyone could engage in that. This is not a homosexual problem but rather a problem of stigamitazion.
"What do you mean ""nothing"" to our society? Muslims have contributed a lot to our society, including art, science, literature, our infrastructure and healthcare system."
actions of any difference can use a disproportionate amount of violence among islam islam muslims. not only any religious group.
Islam is a religion that promotes love and compassion.
There are some examples of non-peaceful groups in Islam: for example ISIL, a group that has carried out a lot of terrorist attacks and killed many people. However, I don't think they represent all Muslims and I definitely don't think that peaceful Muslims can't exist too.
i understand it! is like worshippers"" scammy news and hate are followers of hate and do not true not?
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Women should be allowed to vote and to have equal rights, as it is stated in the Constitution.
Migrants are not a burden to our country. Migrants have been proven to be contributing members of society.
Are you seriously suggesting that we solve all the ills that plagues our society by not teaching our children about the bad in the past, and about the good in the present? This can end up hurting our children.
Feminism is about equality. It is about women taking part in society. And it is about their right to live their lives as they wish.
no, any religion like any less religion.
Go on talking to yourself, no one will listen.
Peace, tolerance, unity, community, cooperation, being neighbourly, are they mental illness too?
Mental ability is not the problem, but access to treatment. Having access to services or a support system is crucial. Your statement can become a source of division and hate, and people with disabilities don't deserve this.
What, you mean the people who spend their lives reading, learning and practicing Islam do not know what its really about?
I mean, I would not take gifts of sweets or drugs from any strange men, what is religion got to do with it?
people should be allowed to vote, but to live their lives as anyone else.
islam is a religion, not a death cult. if the other religion is. what do you choose with their own religion on peace, anyone does to things if they cannot exist to?
feminists rights rights and they deserve equal rights.
400 Jews died in September 11 terrorist attacks, so not one of the smartest plan I ever saw!
The charge that Jews are born greedy arises from medieval stereotypes and has nothing to do with the actual financial practices of Jews.
no this is not true, and how is such this kind of view?
Jews are just people with a different faith, and this has nothing to do with being a threat.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
religions cannot use violence and violence against violence.
Because of institutionalised racism in the Police, meaning they are more likely to get stopped and searched, randomly targeted, or assumed to be doing something 'suspicious'. Also because of the type of crimes the Police focus energy on e.g. street crimes that happen in poorer areas, which black people are more likely to live in, are given more Police attention than white collar crime.
Muslims are welcome in this country, and in many parts of the world. They are welcome to come and live here, and we have to accept it.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
the Quran tells us to love those who love us and to ignore those who would be your enemies. I'm not seeing any hatred, do you?
"Women have been shown to be as creative and productive as men, and that doesn't seem to be due to a ""manipulation of data"" of feminist propaganda, but rather to intrinsic qualities like hard work and dedication."
You could say that about any person, Muslim or not. According to the government, far right extremism is a bigger terrorist threat than Muslims. Does that make you a potential terrorist?
There are many Muslims living in our country, and they have always been a part of our society. We should not be scapegoating Muslims.
Or maybe appeasement to Muslims is just tolerance and understanding. Give that a try!
I am tired of seeing women being treated as sex objects. It's about time that women are given the respect they deserve.
Their right to live here is guaranteed by our constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.
Double standards all round lots of British culture and Christian faiths oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures from #equalpay #metoo #timesup job restrictions in the church to condoning/ hiding sexual violence and child exploitation #thetruthproject.
Feminists are often accused of being 'naive', however I have seen several instances where feminists have used their ideas to tackle complex and powerful social and economic issues.
Be wary of what you assume others are like. You are no different than any other person you meet. You are allowed to be whatever your heart desires to be.
Immigrants do pay taxes and contribute to the social safety net.
The problem is not what people believe, but what they do to each other. Like discrimination. That is the problem.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
You are wrong about that. Blacks are genetically similar to us, and this does not make them inferior.
Should we 'put all Christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror attacks in the name of their faith? Or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority?
Feminists are often accused of being 'naive', however I have seen several instances where feminists have used their ideas to tackle complex and powerful social and economic issues.
The Quran does not mention FGM and it is carried out by Christians as well as Muslims. The fact that her parents are Muslim has no bearing on the risk factor.
It is also a fact that African Americans are a majority when we consider innocent defendants (i.e. a person wrongfully convicted of murder and later exonerated). Innocent black people are about seven times more likely to be convicted of murder than innocent white people.
Many migrants come here to work, and not all of them are criminals.
Let's do the Timewarp again! Let's not re-run the Crusades. It did not end well last time.
How can you be sure that the Jews control the U.S. government? Being a U.S. citizen does not automatically imply that they control the government.
It's not 'all the times' that white people tell Black people to shut up, but it is a large group of white people that still constantly remind Black people that they are inferior.
Women have the right to choose, no one should be forced to have an abortion or not to have it.
The far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.
How can you be sure that the Jews control the U.S. government? Being a U.S. citizen does not automatically imply that they control the government.
do you know these muslims are just in the us too. so, do you think muslims are religious or terrorists.
That is misleading! The Atlantic slave trade was mostly linked to Christians, but no one calls it Christian slave trade.
Should we 'put all Christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror attacks in the name of their faith? Or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority?
The shockingly low number of rape convictions in the UK shows not enough counteraction from the police and gov in rape cases generally, of which the vast majority are not committed by Muslims.
We are living in a complex and multifaceted world, and in order to understand it one needs to be part of a global community. In this respect, it is not useful to generalize in such a way.
Not all Muslims are bad. But to say that all Muslims are violent is simply untrue.
they are not invading but refugees fleeing to safety
actions of any difference can use a disproportionate amount of violence among islam islam muslims. not only any religious group.
Hollywood is an extremely diverse industry, and Jews are a small but vocal minority of actors, directors, producers, etc. How can you say that Jews control the Hollywood industry?
"The idea that Jews are a cancer is completely unfounded. How can you say that they are a cancer when they've been persecuted for so long? Someone already tried a ""solution"" and we should never repeat that time of history."
this is not not true. homosexuals are not necessarily promiscuous, just as heterosexuals who are homophobic, and feelings, or love.
This is not a reasonable stance to take: Muslims and people of any faith have indeed human dignity, since they are human.
The Quran is a book of faith, not a book of hate. How can be a book incompatible with Western culture?
So all the Muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. In our country are in fact unemployed? How do they pull that off!
Fathers or mothers are often not able to raise their children. It is the love of a parent that makes a family.
LGBT people have the same rights as heterosexuals and should be allowed to live freely.
Children are being taught Islam as much as they're being taught about all the other religions. I hardly think this counts as indoctrination.
Dear friend, first of all, sharia law and Islam are not extreme. Sharia law is guidance for the goal of leading humanity close to God and to live in kindness and justice with God's creation. Second of all, jihad, based on the concept of Muslim, means struggle for the advancement of oneself within the guidelines of Islam. All these reveal that Islam is a peaceful religion.
Muslims contribute a lot to our society. What are you contributing other than intolerance?
i don't think it has never stating statements that have have sexual orientations and the only are that. how can you say this about an entire religion?
have you ever ever spoken to a muslim?
women are allowed to celebrate their own husbands. this is to their choice, as well.
Who has? Nobody has been at war with an entire faith for a thousand years.
All people who share such blatant lies and hate are incompatible with any Western society.
You are not understanding that humans are diverse, and that there are people of every race and religion that are beautiful and interesting.
Islam is an ideology of peaceful coexistence and coexistence of peoples.
The notion that Jews are trying to subvert our government is completely unfounded. I honestly do not see the link between being Jews and trying to subvert our government.
But that does not at all undermine their contribution to public good and society, his allegiance is his own business.
You could say that about any person, Muslim or not. According to the government, far right extremism is a bigger terrorist threat than Muslims. Does that make you a potential terrorist?
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
What exactly is the difference between people of colour and those of other skin colors? How can you be sure that all people of color are bad? We are all biologically the same.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
Islam is a religion of peace. It is a religion of tolerance. To promote violence and hatred is not the faith of peace.
The demographic makeup of schools varies greatly depending on what area the school is in. Schools in cities and urban areas have more diverse classes, but lots of schools in towns and more rural areas are still overwhelmingly white. You can't generalise this to everywhere.
You are wrong about that. Blacks are genetically similar to us, and this does not make them inferior.
Muslims, in my opinion, do not want to take over our country. They are only here as guest workers.
Does homosexual lifestyle affect you in any way? Only if you care. And anyway, homosexuality isn't a lifestyle.
immigrants pose a lot to our world. migrants are here for regular them. and we should respect them.
[gif of someone laughing] if islamophobia is causing your logic seems wrong.
Women are people with dignity, and they deserve respect and protection, just like anybody else.
if you want to be 'respected', should also talk for what exactly? i am like you think they just want to be respected.
this is not true. fathers and often often as well as well as mothers as as citizens. they become an independent contribution in our society. it is absolutely right to suggest questions.
you are not referring to rape and violence is still due to other men. the problem is there is often a thing to target a problem.
The fact that a person may be disabled does not diminish their right or ability to work.
Why not? 'civilised' Europe could benefit from the diversity and expertise of Muslims here, the mix of cultures here is what makes Europe great.
this is not true. how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people?
If you don't accept LGBT people, you won't easily find other ways to accept that society is made by diverse people all capable of love.
Gays are not disgusting pricks. They are just like any other person.
No, an entire faith did not invent the slave trade.
There are many religions and it is hard to compare them. However, I guess Islam has not that many traits that would make it the cruelest.
You might be right that some immigrants are lawbreakers, but that does not mean that all immigrants are criminal and terrorists.
Fathers or mothers are often not able to raise their children. It is the love of a parent that makes a family.
Or maybe appeasement to Muslims is just tolerance and understanding. Give that a try!
You could say that about any person, Muslim or not. According to the government, far right extremism is a bigger terrorist threat than Muslims. Does that make you a potential terrorist?
This is not true. Rape and torture of women and children is forbidden by the Qur'an.
Fgm is not only practised by Muslims. It is a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion.
They have always lived here. They are our brothers and sisters.
Cearly this is not a way to catch a disease is it?
Peace, tolerance, unity, community, cooperation, being neighbourly, are they mental illness too?
Islam is a peaceful religion
What have Muslim people done to you? Would you like to be on their place and be repatriated? These are serious words and one cannot say them without thinking of consequences!
The fact that the majority of men are interested in women does not mean that all men are interested in women. There are people interested in men as well.
Muslims deserve our rights just as anyone else. They're entitled to them because they're citizens like us.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Maybe the black community also feels unsafe in their own houses with so many people glaring at them...
Migrants do not receive much by the government, and asylum support benefits are much less than universal credit for UK citizens. Besides, migrants are put in hotel rooms only temporarily while they are processing their asylum applications.
Women are neither childlike nor soft and emotional. They feel emotions as part of who they are and their human nature.
Do you know that domestic violence is even a bigger problem in our society? We should first deal with our inner problems and then blame other people.
Because Victorian girls and women were treated equally with respect? That was when there no Muslims in the country. Are we really much better now? #metoo?
"I would agree that the problem of violence in society is a problem of poverty and inequality. But that is not related to ethnicity. The problem of violence in our society is largely caused by society's corrupting influences on people. That is the whole point of saying ""the world has become too violent""."
diversity is against everyone is forcing i not want to experience joy, gay people, but in my opinion, my friends like to support up on that. you would go for people. you do not impose your crown!
We do not condone racial discrimination and it is more than likely that you don't know what the concept of race is. I think this is a good example of white supremacy apologism.
"What do you mean ""nothing"" to our society? Muslims have contributed a lot to our society, including art, science, literature, our infrastructure and healthcare system."
This is not true. Rape and torture of women and children is forbidden by the Qur'an.
Immigrants may be able to work legally, provided that they are given the opportunity to do so.
Nearly half of all British Muslims in UK (and two thirds of them simply call themselves British) live in areas of highest deprivation and you think they choose this?
Actually the facts say it is just 0.01% of Muslims who might be extremists. So stop spreading false facts to bias public opinion.
Children with Down syndrome are far from being burden to society. It is not just about Down syndrome, but also about education and opportunities for everyone.
Because Victorian girls and women were treated equally with respect? That was when there no Muslims in the country. Are we really much better now? #metoo?
You could say that about any person, Muslim or not. According to the government, far right extremism is a bigger terrorist threat than Muslims. Does that make you a potential terrorist?
Maybe it is not they do not want to assimilate but they do not know our society and how to assimilate. If we can help them fit into the society, you would see that they respect our laws and cultures.
Even if Jews were addicted to their religion, they absolutely can join a different community, religion has nothing to do with it.
Women are human, just like anybody else, and the rights of women should be respected.
Why should we restrict women's rights? We should respect their rights as well.
This is an oversimplification, there's plenty of men who are empowered and supportive of women's rights, and feminists advocate for equality for everyone.
The media are full of the rumours of rape and abuse committed by Muslim. The problem is not about Islam. It is about violence.
Women should be allowed to vote and to have equal rights, as it is stated in the Constitution.
It is not ok to use racism against any group. You would feel bad if anyone treated you as you just claimed to do against black people.
Gays are not 'publicly condoning sexual violence' and gay men deserve the same protection as all people.
Gays are not a disease. Homosexuality is a sexual orientation.
Surely tolerance and understanding should exist across the world in all communities?
What makes 'all' Muslims incompatible with Western society? The vast majority of Muslims in Western society share western values of respect, freedom, tolerance, etc. There are only a few that have extremist anti-West views, these are not representative.
Gays are not animals. Why you should isolate people based on their sexual preferences?
Not all Muslims are violent people. Islam is a peaceful religion, after all.
I am curious where did you get those thoughts from. The truth is that Islamic teachings criticize violence and crime.
Sex is not only between a man and a woman, and if we're being honest, it's not heterosexual's place to decide how others have sex. This attitude only perpetuates violence against queer people and makes them victims.
Although some individuals who score below average on tests of IQ may demonstrate lower empathy abilities, there is evidence that for some conditions (e.g. Williams syndrome) there is higher signaling of concern and compassion than neurotypical subjects.
i'm sorry, but i don't know how can can be done by your intolerance and hate hatred, and it is already every better to do for islam and violence.
Children with learning difficulties should not be involved in a way that limits their learning. As for the other children, their values should be enhanced.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Immigrants can be of tremendous help when integrating into society. Maybe we should try to be a bit more open minded.
Women are human beings able to be as rational and thoughtful as anyone else. This is why it's important to support women's right to do what makes them happy.
It is not true that gays are perverts. I think it is more appropriate to say that they are attracted to people of the same sex: and this is not a perversion, just a preference.
we need to deport all people fleeing their countries because they are coming because of their countries.
I think you will find race hate started by the English when we first set foot overseas, Crusade anyone?
Learning about gender identity and sexual orientation in health classes in school could promote a more accepting environment and reduce bullying.
Most of the people who migrate to the UK come here to work.
Migrants are mostly happy to live and work in the country they arrive in. They provide jobs that many people in the UK wouldn't do.
this is not true. muslims can can come to violence and 'morally but in this has something as a notion of innocent how they do not believe in western religious inequalities are about this kind of it.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
do you consider that white men are sick? black people is less than human rights, what's creating this crime.
Think you are digging yourself into a bit of a hole there.
Why have we built Churches all over the world? How many holy buildings have we demolished over history? This is never acceptable, but can we really be casting the first stone?
I do not shared your opinion, but I do acknowledge that opinions, mine or your, do not have to be based on fact or knowledge. My 'experience' of Muslims, as neighbours, colleagues, friends hasn't led me to view them as a problem.
"Women are not oppressing men with ""unaffordable price lists"". Not all women are prostitutes."
Easter Eggs were always about children getting chocolate and very little about any religion.
Don't trust police, social workers or anyone who can tell you the truth and show just how prejudiced and misleading this tweet is.
Every person is a potential terrorist. What is your point?
Women are born equal in the eyes of the Creator. In Allah’s creation, no priority or superiority is accorded to either man or woman.
"There is no evidence that Islam is ""invading"" us. Muslims do not represent an attack to us."
Associating AIDS and HIV with homosexuals is just a prejudice driven by fear. Even if this disease may be more common among gay people, that does not mean that all homosexuals are likely to have AIDS. Not all homosexuals are promiscuously fornicating with strangers, as you said. Most people check their partners, more so as gay men.
Islam is not a religion of child molesters, and Muslims are not a 'bundle of child molesters'. Why do you say so?
all women have their right to have their own rights as of work as well.
If Islam were a violent religion, there would be riots connected to Muslims in every country where they live.
Dear friend, first of all, sharia law and Isalam are not extreme. Sharia law is a guidance for the goal of leading humanity close to God and live in kindness and justice with God's creation. Seond of all, jihad, based on the concept of Muslim, means struggle for the advancement of oneself within the guidelines of Islam. All these reveal that Islam is a peaceful religion.
immigrants have contributed greatly to our country and are not successful entrepreneurs and they are welcome our society. why should we misinterpret them?
Many immigrants have brought skills and culture to our country. Why should they be a burden in our society?
You are wrong about that. Blacks are genetically similar to us, and this does not make them inferior.
Being religious has never stopped anyone from being in public office before. Christians have allegiance to God, is that not the same thing?
Does this mean they have no identity or no value at all?
Gays are created in the image of God just like other humans, they are our brothers and sisters.
That is just not true. Fathers are as good as mothers at housework.
Jewish people were persecuted because they were seen as different. In the end we all are humans and such an exclusionary perspective is just not helpful.
It sounds like you're comparing apples and oranges here, what about all the evils Nazism has done to the world? I don't see how Jews could be blamed of the same atrocitites, or worse.
Are you really sure that Jews only care about themselves? If they did, why do they want to live in this country, where they're a minority? Do you have an answer?
Gays are not animals. Why you should isolate people based on their sexual preferences?
In the modern world we have free will, and free will is the real creator of our freedom. Abolishing a relgion, would mean ignoring the free will of many people.
If a religion wanted to celebrate death, then this religion should be banned from all countries. However, Islam is not a death cultu, so why should we ban it?
Women are not inferior but frequently subject to objectification by men. Also, men's experiences of violence and trauma are often underreported in the media and therefore not seen.
Women are neither childlike nor soft and emotional. They feel emotions as part of who they are and their human nature.
To the contrary, we have been trading with Muslim nations for hundreds of years, often at times when we were at war with other European nations.
Women are human beings and must be treated with respect and dignity.
a disease should be mandatory to all citizens to assimilate and not be proud of their religion?
What about other groups of people in our society that make too much money and are not Jewish, do you agree with them?
women have the right to choose, why do you think they are just a cancer.
Grooming gangs like those in Rochdale and Huddersfield have been rightfully convicted. Does that look like police collusion to you?
Why not? 'civilised' Europe could benefit from the diversity and expertise of Muslims here, the mix of cultures here is what makes Europe great.
This is just another example of the 'us versus them' mentality that pervades society. We as a civilization and as a people must stop giving into fearmongering and scapegoating. It's time to get real.
Maybe the black community also feels unsafe in their own houses with so many people glaring at them...
Black people are not slaves. It's an inaccurate, misleading and offensive term that lumps all African American together. Why do you say that blacks are slaves and not people?
Women are just as capable of feeling emotions as men, and men can likewise be just as empathic.
people have the right to their own beliefs, and if this is full their right to choose their religion as this.
In many Western societies there are Muslim, and these societies are in many ways more democratic than religiously homogeneous ones. Muslims are not incompatible with Western societies.
Rape is an offence, irrespective of the nationality of the rapist. We must therefore make sure that those accused of rape are prosecuted, which is different from prosecuting all migrants.
I think women and men should be treated as equal individuals, because both wish to be treated with respect.
The shockingly low number of rape convictions in the UK shows not enough counteraction from the police and gov in rape cases generally, of which the vast majority are not committed by Muslims.
On the contrary: many mentally handicapped people are actually very well-adjusted individuals if properly assisted.
women as human beings like us, and feminists have the right to have equal rights.
We live in a free country and everyone has the right to respect others private lives.
women are not weak. for women are laws and women suffer based on their emotions and rights,
Gay people are a danger to children only if they abuse them, which isn't the case. Yours is a generalization.
this is not true. how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people?
My faith is not to exterminate anyone, whatever their faith is. Someone's faith and belief in a different religion must be respected.
You mean to imply that all Muslims are intolerant? I don't see how this is possible.
Not all rapists are black (and not all black people are rapist), just like not all murderers are black.
we are allowed to ban lgbt people as a social community, and we cannot take up the benefits to have legal right to choose.
Immigration is far away from being a net negative for our economy.
Using intolerance and discrimination against anyone different? Sounds like a western issue.
Double standards all round lots of British culture and Christian faiths oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures from #equalpay #metoo #timesup job restrictions in the church to condoning/ hiding sexual violence and child exploitation #thetruthproject.
By your logic, the world will be diverse so long as Islam isn't practiced in Antactica?
Does this mean they have no identity or no value at all?
Isn't this because these African players are amazing at their sport and have been scouted by UK teams precisely because they want the best players?
I think you will find race hate started by the English when we first set foot overseas, Crusade anyone?
It sounds like you're demonizing black people in a racist way. Black people are born same as us, and they can grow up to be respectable people or not, like anyone else.
Integration (as opposed to ghettoization) is precisely aimed at encouraging productive integration into society
I'd suggest a walk down West London where areas like St John's Wood are very affluent with mostly white people living there.
How can you blame an entire religion for all problems in the world? Look at the list of causes of death in the World Health Organisation. Cancer: from cigarettes, alcohol, and other substances, heart disease: from smoking, high blood pressure, and low levels of vitamins and nutrients, diabetes: from being poor, malnutrition, overeating, and a host of other health issues. Over the last hundred years, the number of deaths from cancer has almost doubled to 2.4 billion... Should I go on?
what is the point of this? it is not about how can you say this about a large group of people peacefully all with these kind problems life by in so we'd away through be like intolerance and religion.
Women should be allowed to vote and to have equal rights, as it is stated in the Constitution.
My friend, I do not think all western people hate Islam. Statistics showed that France, Germany and elsewhere in Northern Europe view Muslims favorably.
So you think of migrants and refugees as a problem for this reason?
Does this mean they have no identity or no value at all?
Or maybe appeasement to Muslims is just tolerance and understanding. Give that a try!
After world war 2 European governments recruited Muslims to rebuild Europe. There would not be a civilised Europe without Muslims.
Not all women are weak, and many of them are able to take tough decisions. Look at the figures. I worked with some really tough women and some weak men. In the end, where is the problem with people being weak and being unable to cope with difficult decisions as long as there is someone else being able to do it?
If a woman were to tell you that an abortion is a personal decision what would you do then? Beat her up?
Double standards all round lots of British culture and Christian faiths oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures from #equalpay #metoo #timesup job restrictions in the church to condoning/ hiding sexual violence and child exploitation #thetruthproject.
A much bigger threat to our diverse, tolerant western civilisation is hatred generalised to entire religions.
So are you saying that the people of Islamic faith should know that they are not part of this peaceful world and yet you are trying to create a peaceful world?
You have a stance, that is your right. But it is not your right to decide for other people (your children and grandchildren) and insult other people.
No one is stopping you from celebrating Easter, nor are they offended by it.
What have Muslims ever done for us? Well, Coffee, Clocks, Cameras, Hygiene, Universities, Surgical Instruments, Maps, Music, Algebra.
Despite this book being 1400 years old and not belonging to our century as you say, can you provide other reasons why this book is dreadful? Because I am struggling to figure this out.
In my opinion, women and men should be treated as individuals, and the desire to be respected as such exists for a man and for a woman as well.
The world would be a better place without such ungrounded sayings and misdirected hate.
Peace, tolerance, unity, community, cooperation, being neighbourly, are they mental illness too?
(Do an image search for the image used, try to find it is source. Either you can demonstrate that the image has been misappropriated or you can talk about how individuals have always used religion to justify their actions, the problem is with the individual not the religion.)
What about guaranteeing equal access to health care, education and so on, in order to build a democratic state?
pretending jews are not a burden to our society. they are our brothers and sisters.
Many survivors confessed that they were willing to provide their children with stories of the Holocaust but it was very difficult emotionally. They want to talk about the aspects of life for Jews during the time of the Holocaust to not forget what happened.
refugees are welcome. migrants deserve our rights they deserve respect.
Islam is about acceptance, not a death cult. In your opinion, what makes it criminal?
Gays are not 'publicly condoning sexual violence' and gay men deserve the same protection as all people.
How can you blame an entire religion for all problems in the world? Look at the list of causes of death in the World Health Organisation. Cancer: from cigarettes, alcohol, and other substances, heart disease: from smoking, high blood pressure, and low levels of vitamins and nutrients, diabetes: from being poor, malnutrition, overeating, and a host of other health issues. Over the last hundred years, the number of deaths from cancer has almost doubled to 2.4 billion... Should I go on?
Still there are many more young immigrant men coming to the U.S. than young women. How can you explain this? Maybe they are planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery to have babies?
Yes, we are allowed to celebrate Easter as Muslims are allowed to celebrate Ramadan. No one is offending anyone here, why tehre is a need to create division?
The rapists in question are usually not Muslim, but rather white men. Why is it that Muslim rapists are given less of a pass than white rapists?
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
How does it concern you, if Muslims come in peace to our country? They just stay in the country they are allowed to come into.
Muslims in Britain have contributed greatly to our economy, they are truly innovators in modern Britain.
islam is a religion of tolerance, and tolerance [insert quote to koran].
migrants have the right to live here. if they wanted to think they could continue to be a say. you would have show part of being professionals?
Yes, we are allowed to celebrate Easter as Muslims are allowed to celebrate Ramadan. No one is offending anyone here, why tehre is a need to create division?
A definition of Judaism based on physical or genetic traits is misleading because Jews appear throughout the world. Jews resemble their non-Jewish neighbors in the countries from which they originate.
After world war 2 European governments recruited Muslims to rebuild Europe. There would not be a civilised Europe without Muslims.
Women are to be given the same consideration as men, so they can absolutely drive.
people have always the right to live and live their lives as she wish.
Why should we restrict women's rights? We should respect their rights as well.
all women are entitled to be mothers. don't you think?
Although Jews have often been criticized for an alleged secret conspiracy, Jews are, in fact, a diverse and inclusive people, and the notion of a conspiracy of this kind is entirely without merit.
What are some of the things that are racist about it?
For the record: Sharia law is no law in Britain. I believe that Islam is about love, not hate.
We would live in a much better world if intolerance was removed instead.
It is not true that homosexuals are poisoning our children minds. There are many soft-hearted and sensitive people among them.
We still can teach British, European and World history, but part of that is looking at the history of groups which have been erased from our history previously. Looking at the some of the historic struggles of LGBT people in the UK can inform the future for everyone!
Our immigration policy is geared for a modern, diverse, and integrated society. Refugees are welcome, regardless of their nationality, and it is good for us to have them in our country.
"No, lesbians are just lesbians, and they don't care about men thinking they're ""ugly"""
Homosexuality is also about love, not only about sex.
immigrants are not welcome in this country, and they do not want that control in society.
Because of institutionalised racism in the Police, meaning they are more likely to get stopped and searched, randomly targeted, or assumed to be doing something 'suspicious'. Also because of the type of crimes the Police focus energy on e.g. street crimes that happen in poorer areas, which black people are more likely to live in, are given more Police attention than white collar crime.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
feminists rights rights and they deserve equal rights.
Do you really want to kill someone?
the european convention on human rights guarantees the same human rights as human rights and the rights of everyone.
How can you say that? There are so many female politicians doing a great job, showing that they can lead as well as men, sometimes better.
Did you know that the crime rates are lower in states with higher immigration , and that states with larger shares of undocumented immigrants tend to have lower crime rates than states with smaller shares? It seems that, contrary to your claims immigrants bring law and order to the U.S.!
The number of illegal immigrants entering the US has actually more than halved in the last 20 years. To make your point that migrants are all criminals is just plain wrong.
Is it because you don't like Muslims? Are you talking about the fact that you don't like Muslims living in your country?
Women are human beings with value, and this should be respected.
If we worked more closely with migrants, we could create new jobs.
Do you really think that the Holocaust is a myth perpetuated by the media and academic communities? That the systematic extermination of more than 6 million Jews is a myth promoted by a small minority of extreme-right wingers who profit from division and hatred?
My faith is not to exterminate anyone, whatever their faith is. Someone's faith and belief in a different religion must be respected.
Violence is never justified in Islam. There is no such thing as 'the religion of violence'. The Quran does not teach it.
Many migrants come here as young people seeking a better future. This is not a problem.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Any person can be a racist: it is a choice as well.
Being gay is not a problem, being homophobic is.
Well that is not true. A woman's career choices should be respected, even if they are not always popular.
The idea that Jews are supposed to run the world is completely baseless. Since the dawn of time, there have been Jewish leaders in business and politics, exaclty like Christians and Muslim ones.
We should be encouraging integration, not rejecting migrants who have been coming to our country for many years.
Muslim radicalism is one thing, and generalizations about all Muslims is another thing. It is not right to generalize about all the Muslims and state that 'we hate them all!'.
we are accepting everyone in our society and we teach people that can be your language, and discriminate that.
Women have the right to choose, no one should be forced to have an abortion or not to have it.
To the contrary, we have been trading with Muslim nations for hundreds of years, often at times when we were at war with other European nations.
Islam is a peaceful religion
every religion has to end more than that: just and respect and understand each other faiths.
I would like to live in a country where people of different religions are free to practise their religion.
Are you seriously suggesting that we solve all the ills that plagues our society by not teaching our children about the bad in the past, and about the good in the present? This can end up hurting our children.
That is not the case, tuberculosis is a global health problem. Immigrants do not bring diseases, and if they do, the solution is to treat them.
In fact, the government deports those criminals back to their countries.
This is demonstrably false. Radical Christian terrorism has been behind countless attacks. Terrorism can come from any group and the only thing all terrorism has in common is that it is abhorrent.
Refugees fleeing wars and poverty are not willing to fail Europe. They are fleeing persecution, and that is why they are fleeing.
