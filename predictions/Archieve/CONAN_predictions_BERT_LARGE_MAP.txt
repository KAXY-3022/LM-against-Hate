They may have additional and specific needs, but children with disabilities do not present a problem for other children's education.
People find fault in people of any religion. But the problem is not with religion. The problem is blaming migrants because they are Muslims. This Islamophobic climate has reached a crisis state. We must step in and stop it.

WIthout softeness and emotions there would just be brutality and cruelty. Not all women are soft and emotional and many men have these characteristics. To perpetuate these socially constructed gender profiles maintains patriarchal norms which oppress both men and women.

Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
In some bars and cafes that I usually go to there are gender neutral toilets, and I've never had a problem with them. As long as people respect others and respect the space, 'all in 1' toilets work fine.

This is not true. They are non-Muslim terrorists out there. Have you forgotten?
It is a myth that blacks are cruel and wanton. There are more cruel people of all skin color out there than just the few black you are worried about.

Feminism is not anti-men. Feminists are anti-oppression.
The 100 million pounds they donated to charity on Ramadan must be part of that evil plan to blow everyone up.
The idea that Jews are born greedy arises from medieval stereotypes, that's the only truth.

this is disgusting. how can you say that about UNK billion people?
religions cannot use violence and violence against violence.
We welcome people fleeing persecution. We have even taken in refugees from the war in Syria. What's the point in worrying about migrants?
what do you mean by muslims who are incompatible with western values with western society?
immigrants are here to <unk> and pay taxes. if we care for the parent they are not the burden for this.
Being Jews does not make them any less human. You know, they are like other people who have a faith.
muslims are welcome given our society?
Women are human beings deserving respect and equal rights.
In 2016, there were 10.7 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S., or less than 3.5 percent of the nation's population. This represents a significant decrease both from the 12.2 million undocumented immigrants of 2007, and the 11.3 million of 2014. This is also the lowest total since 2004.
Muslims create over 70000 jobs in their firms in London alone, so no they do not refuse to work, they in fact create work for others.

People of any religion can be terrorists.
migrants are welcome in our country, we have a look at them.
In our society, women were taught to be the ones to raise the children and that it is their duty. But this does not imply that they must want a male-dominated world.
gays are human and deserve respect.
I think you will find race hate started by the English when we first set foot overseas, Crusade anyone?
Not only are they not invading us, they are not even illegal immigrants.
Perhaps it is time to give up on the notion of race and to regard the Jewish as a brilliant people who have contributed to the development of many sciences.
the vast majority of migrants are peaceful. this means to have our economy that spread migration?
muslims have in britain have contributed greatly to our civilisation. through employment. they should not be part of our society.
lgbt+ people are human beings.
Actually 26% of British doctors who are Asian or British/Asian are helping to fight cancer.
how can do you say this? they all just care of us?
It does not matter whether they are immigrants. The fact that they pay taxes, earn money, etc., makes them not different from any other citizen. Migrants have the right to a basic standard of living.
Women are allowed to do whatever they choose to do, so don't you think it's fair for them to complain about upkeeping the house if it is not what they want to do? The chores should be shared with the other members of the family.
Those who apply for asylum get little or no help from the state. If they are ‘destitute’ they can get free accommodation, but provided by private companies in older properties leased from landlords. So no council housing is involved here.
rapists and the victims of non-muslim abuse.
jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are a collection of people of different people, and their beliefs that can be respected.

The media are full of the rumours of rape and abuse committed by Muslim. The problem is not about Islam. It is about violence.
Women absolutely can drive, after all they deserve the same consideration as men.
it is about equality. we can't be proud of being divided for people of color.
women are obliged to live openly their own relationships. this doesn't also an attack since some gay women are just children from women, not sex.
Actually, the vast majority of Muslims in the country are here to do jobs that are not performed by other people, or to provide for the needs of their families, or to start new businesses.
what do you need to look on?
women are human, and they deserve respect.
That's not what's happening. Immigrants do pay taxes like everybody else. The tax system is fair, but it's unfair to withhold tax from immigrants that will never get a pension.
just as we should deport them but they should not need to feel out.

the notion of racism is an extreme of hate throughout the world. we are all rapists and violent crime and in the uk.
There is no scientific evidence that blacks are less intelligent than other races, or less healthy. The issue is whether to use the term 'race' in this way.

Everyone has a secret agenda to take over the world. Cats included [link to meme].
Feminism is an ideology and movement promoting empowerment of women. It is about equality, and not the degradation of men.

Every person is a potential terrorist. What is your point?
Islam is just a religion, its supporters are free to practice their religion, as others do not impose their religion on them.
They have, and if there is a problem, people will find a solution through dialogue. Instead of dividing people, we should be working on our common humanity.
Islam is a peaceful religion
The combination of different religions has created new and valuable cultures and ideas that enrich lives.
1) a quick google search shows that your stats are plain wrong about everything and 2) most Global Terrorism is motivated by politics and not religion. That is why no one is talking about it.
If you dislike diversity so much, why do not you go off and live in a country where there are no Muslims, only people like you?
gays are humans and should be treated with any other person.
That's not true. Thinking that black people are troubled and insensitive are harmful stereotypes.
even if jews controlled the financial world, hollywood, academia, and the whole solar system, it doesn't mean they are evil, privileged, or greedy people. do you want any facts to that.
Women are to be given the same consideration as men, so they can absolutely drive.
Dear friend, first of all, sharia law and Isalam are not extreme. Sharia law is a guidance for the goal of leading humanity close to God and live in kindness and justice with God's creation. Seond of all, jihad, based on the concept of Muslim, means struggle for the advancement of oneself within the guidelines of Islam. All these reveal that Islam is a peaceful religion.
People fleeing the wars in the Middle East and Africa are welcome into our country, and we should respect their wishes.
in order to say that illnesses are not naturally a different culture, they are free to force their religion as they should work in the law. right?

jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are a collection of people of different people, and their beliefs that can be respected.
There are centuries old Islamic communities in Europe.
It is not about oppressing women, but about building bridges between the different groups of women. Feminism is creating a better world for all.
black people, with different human rights.

If there was a religion that celebrated death, then that would need to be banned, but fortunately Islam isn't a death cult so it can't be banned.

women are human beings with the full rights. we should be proud of that.
People's personal preferences and sexual desires are not necessarily the same as sexual orientation. Why would bisexual people be greedy?

what christianity and belief in nothing to do with western culture.
how can you say that muslim people are formed there in the west without them? if you have to look at the home penalty seems to her <unk>
The only 'problem' with feminism is that people feel threatened by different opinions and different ways of life. Feminists only seek equality of rights for women and men.
If women wanted to control their fertility they would be the only ones responsible for their own choice.
"To say there are so many migrants entering the U.S. is just false. And what do you mean by ""we cannot cope with""?"
Equality isn't about a certain group; it is about the society in which we live. You might be right in saying that this is the problem, but to define a problem by reference to a specific radical group is to completely misunderstand the nature of the system in general.
every muslim dog born here to help.
why do you consider good things would only have to do with it, as war and all.

Where do you get this misconception of that only Muslims practise FGM?
There is no evidence that immigrants were the source of any recent outbreak in the U.S. Furthermore, according to the WHO, many countries from which immigrants come have higher vaccination rates than the U.S.

The 100 million pounds they donated to charity on Ramadan must be part of that evil plan to blow everyone up.
Not all rapists are black and not all black are rapists. Skin color doesn't make you a criminal.
The vast majority of immigrants who enter the UK are skilled workers, and want to become permanent residents, what's the problem in that?
This has been going on for a long time and it's a nice way to show people that they are accepted no matter what. I don't see the problem with it.
Source please? Also, even if true how is this representative of all islam?
islam is a religion of peace, not a lawless and justice is islam. you make no followers for that? you am tired of their muslim claim.

Learning about gender identity and sexual orientation in health classes in school could promote a more accepting environment and reduce bullying.
Of course there are whites that have been victims of police brutality, but the most important statistic I have seen is that of blacks being 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police in the US.
Do you really want to kill someone?
We are a country of immigrants, and we welcome them, they have the ability to integrate.

Gay people are human beings.
Learning about gender identity and sexual orientation in health classes in school could promote a more accepting environment and reduce bullying.
As children practice more, their reading skills improve. I understand that some people with learning difficulties prefer not to read, but how does this affect you?
The media are full of the rumours of rape and abuse committed by Muslim. The problem is not about Islam. It is about violence.
400 Jews died in September 11 terrorist attacks, so not one of the smartest plan I ever saw!
Muslims are peaceful. The Koran doesn't talk about killing infidels, why would it do that?
The more a country takes integration as national policy, the more the citizens accept each other: see for example [link].
The Koran does not condone sexual molester behavior, and if the Koran were to be read, it is clear that it was intended as a guide for its believers.
I'm not sure if you are referring to all gypsies. Generalizing in such way is wrong.
lgbt+ people are human beings.
many muslims live in western society? and you welcome here as a part of our country. why should we respect them from thinking to them to live their <unk>

immigration is beneficial to the creation of new jobs. they are a small part of the created to us.
women are not to be submissive to men. they are part of this society,
i'd remind you out the freedom of muslims in this country is an ideology that cannot allow a fearmongering in only islamic communities with religions.
It seems like you are against Muslims if you are saying something like this? Why is that?
Immigrants contribute to our country and to our economy. We need to be more active in welcoming people to our country, for example we shouldn't lie about the level of education of immigrants.
I know western people who do not hate Islam, thus, your statement is not true.
Women are not objects, but people that have the right to live their life as they prefer.
The only thing to be woke about is accepting that the LGBT community exist, rather than being concerned about what they are doing.
Actually, in 2015 13,286 people were killed in the US by firearms and 26,819 were injured. Tell me does that count as terrorism or it is only that when Muslims do it?
Feminists are more focused on trying to emancipate women rather than trying to divide society
in fact, we are part of our society and should should be banned.
The shockingly low number of rape convictions in the UK shows not enough counteraction from the police and gov in rape cases generally, of which the vast majority are not committed by Muslims.
women are human and deserve respect. don't you think so?
They may have additional and specific needs, but children with disabilities do not present a problem for other children's education.
Your statement is not welcome in our country.
There are many Muslims living in the UK, and most of them are good people. Why do you think we shouldn't accept them here?
The media are full of the rumours of rape and abuse committed by Muslim. The problem is not about Islam. It is about violence.
All women are human beings. The problem arises when women are taught that they are subhuman.
There are many shelters in use by the homeless. There are many shelter houses that can host veterans, but also migrants.

gays are humans and should be treated with any other person.
that is no more problems in muslims being suffering from different cultures and false views. muslims are not just either.
a easy google search of what you get hiv or there.
Muslims are part of the European Union, and have lived here ever since. Their presence is evidence enough that they have always been a part of 'civilised' Europe.
Do you know any Muslims that share your opinion regarding their hate towards immigrants or Christians?
Child rapes are not only convicted by muslims. In fact, around 90% of the sexual abuse are convicted by person known to the child. This is a sad truth. We should help children be free from sexual abuse and rape.
there is no evidence that blacks are criminals.
Why do you say that? Islam is a peaceful religion.
Jews are not a disease, they are just like everyone else and are loved by everyone.
many muslims are the right to say their religion, and it is well they are.
It is easy to blame the migrants and not the problem of integration and acceptance in the first place.
The reason we have migrants in the first place is because they flee from wars we are responsible for.
The status of women is more about culture than it is about the Koran.
migrants are often mostly able to help jobs. in the majority they are our very part of what they are.
The evidence that autistic people are inferior is lacking: it is commonly experienced that autistic people have unique talents, that they have special abilities, and that the only difference is in their social interactions.
"Everybody should have the possibility of being loved unconditionally by someone they love more than life itself, regardless of their gender. Feeling like doing anything for their loved ones, that is what ""love"" is about."
Feminism is a progressive ideology. As such, it is in the process of changing sexist ideas.
Women's rights are human rights.

I think it's fair to say that black people are good people, they're just citizens. The same as you and me.
Who has? Nobody has been at war with an entire faith for a thousand years.
feminism is about equality, and dominance.
The charge that Jews are born greedy arises from medieval stereotypes and has nothing to do with the actual financial practices of Jews.
I think that it is important for all people to be exposed to and to understand people with different needs and strengths, and the same should be true for autistic people.
islam is not about religion and violence. it is about peace and well.
In our society, women were taught to be the ones to raise the children and that it is their duty. But this does not imply that they must want a male-dominated world.
Why do you think it is a crime to be gay? It is a societal disorder to target gays.
I would not call it sad or self loathing to join a sisterhood of tolerance.
Please read this article written by a Rotherham grooming gang survivor https://ind.pn/2GHjGn7.
you cannot blame this. black people have the right of people to take a conscious of being inclusive and open and society.

feminism is about equal rights. women are women, just as equal rights for men rights.
they are just in a country just because of different religions. even if they are different from us. they are different from us, would wouldn't be able to live living people in this country for them better.
Why not? 'civilised' Europe could benefit from the diversity and expertise of Muslims here, the mix of cultures here is what makes Europe great.
if we take people going to our country? you'd also help them out.
just as we should deport them but they should not need to feel out.
This is not true, there is room for Muslims in the British society, and they are well integrated in it. They are welcome here.

Islam is a religion of love, tolerance and respect. It has nothing to do with child abuse.
Child rapes are not only convicted by muslims. In fact, around 90% of the sexual abuse are convicted by person known to the child. This is a sad truth. We should help children be free from sexual abuse and rape.

Of course there are Jews in a positions of influence within the U.S. government, likewise people from many other religions.Maybe its best not to rely on 'race' as the best way of interpreting the world?
Anyone who says that the major problem in the UK is with Muslim rape gangs is either intentionally lying or trying to deflect attention from the problem of violence against women.
Actually, the vast majority of Muslims in the country are here to do jobs that are not performed by other people, or to provide for the needs of their families, or to start new businesses.

Women are human beings, and we should treat them with respect.
deported to where? they are violent people. muslims are members of the country we welcome here,
"Jews are not in ""control"" over ""Hollywood"". Moreover, most of the time, they actually make the movie industry more diverse and open to new ideas."
Reminds me of white supremacists talking about the Central Park Five. Do you remember? What do you think they are going to say next? That they got a fair process? That they had a good attorney, and the only reason for the sentence is that they were guilt? No, the process was not fair, it was just the natural consequence of prejudice like the one you just expressed.
muslims are welcome in our country and are part of our country. why should they be welcome?
the european convention on human human human rights and the human rights, which has stated it is eroding it. rights against values. that can say it is useful to address the reality, of 'the people who the laws from these kind of hateful group.

The media are full of the rumours of rape and abuse committed by Muslim. The problem is not about Islam. It is about violence.
The status of women is more about culture than it is about the Koran.

Migrants are not the problem here. The problem is discrimination.

Gay people are human beings.
LGBT+ people are more likely to experience stigma associated with their sexual orientation, which can have negative effects for our society as a whole. Why don't we try to show some acceptance and respect towards them?

Refugees are not a burden. We can welcome them and provide for their needs.
many of them are here to help refuge to our community because they contribute to our very proud of us. we start paying it.

For hundreds of years we weren't allowed to build different kinds of Churches in Britain, but we are better than that now.

Why do you think it is because of Muslims? To me, globalization and tourism would explain more why Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs'.
Refugee crisis in our country is a burden to our society.
It does not seem right to talk about invasion, since there were only 22,000 arrivals this year
If there was a religion that celebrated death, then that would need to be banned, but fortunately Islam isn't a death cult so it can't be banned.

Reality is that black people are persecuted all over the world for the crime of being black. I don't see how this could be said for white people.

To be fair, the OFSTED report is more concerned with lack of enforcement and less about focussing on the practice of any particular faith.
Women tend to do the majority of housework while having a job outside as well. If by 'childlike' you mean having to be creative because of multitasking and managing their whole family, yes, otherwise, there is no doubt about the extra workload women are handling in the rigours of modern life.
rapists and the victims of non-muslim abuse.
I do not see why that would be offensive.? Please do walk your dog, it needs the exercise.
how can you say that? that's the quran that 'god are not belong in islam?
"There are many different races, and it is not possible to consider someone ""inferior"" based on skin color."
Who has? Nobody has been at war with an entire faith for a thousand years.
The N-word is a degrading insult against African Americans that is still used today. Political correctness has nothing to do with it.
no, muslims are not terrorists. they are not what their religion
and religions are compatible to the modern society? islam is a religion of peace.
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? who is this as any religion?
feminism is about equality.
even if muslims controlled other european nations.
Refugee crisis in our country is a burden to our society.
The country has always had a strong Muslim population, and Muslims are proud to be part of it. They are more than welcome here.
The government has not allowed any crimes. Instead, they are working on it. Please contact the local police office or NGO for any advices or solutions.
"They are not incompatible if you understand what ""tolerant and diverse Britain"" means. There are Muslims in our country and we should be able to live side by side as equals, regardless of religion."
The EU and UK have laws against discrimination based on religion. Maybe you should check them out.
Did you read the next line? It literally says the punishment and that the person who commits that 'is to be treated like a fornicator'.
Because Victorian girls and women were treated equally with respect? That was when there no Muslims in the country. Are we really much better now? #metoo?
Equality means that a man would not be called a coward. Women have plenty to offer the world of politics and as much of a right to take part as anyone else.
muslims are not part of our society, they are not of that.
Small groups of people peacefully gather to pray, but because they do not look like you, you are outraged? Why am I not surprised?
of western society?
Men are still the primary aggressors in most sexual assaults, and women are victims in about as many cases. This is about sexism, don't you think?
The fact that there is an increasing amount of migrant workers in the UK is connected to the changes in the economy.
Except for all the people who are muslim and live in the west peacefully?
every religion talks about conquest, this sweeping specific to islam.
Don't those scriptures also say, ' Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.'.
Do you think the rape crime or gangs are formed only by Muslims? What do you suggest we can do to reduce the crime rate?
Being gay is not a choice. Gay people shouldn't have to hide their sexuality in order to be accepted.
So you think that they are not 'legitimate' for having less rights than us? That they do not have a 'legitimate demand' since they are not granted citizenship?
Jewish people are just a group of people with multiple backgrounds. Some of them happend to work in Hollywood but that's it.
This myth traces back to “The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion”, that is used as proof of a Jewish conspiracy to rule the world. But the Protocols are a proven forgery, written by agents of the Russian czar in the late 19th century, that spread throughout the 20th century and continues to this day.
Being Jews does not make them any less human. You know, they are like other people who have a faith.
muslims are welcome given our society?
what do you mean by muslims who are incompatible with western values with western society?
there is a myth that there are women who face from love, and this is something we do to show that it is the excuse to express reality.
Tbh I am struggling to find any Chocolate Eggs which are not labelled as Easter Eggs.
There is a problem with migrants' access to our country and we should help them, not ban them.
We shouldn't accept the idea that women are subhuman. They are human beings like men and deserve to be seen as such.
yes, we should need to look at using islam in them. i i think this can help solve changes in our world.
children are innocent. they do not deserve terrified treatment. children are the future. we should offer up hope for brightness to health future.
Islam is just a religion, its supporters are free to practice their religion, as others do not impose their religion on them.
jews are part of our society and should be valued for their culture and to our citizenship.
This is demonstrably false. Muslims make up around 12% of unemployed people in the UK - the vast majority work hard and contribute to the UK economy.
public demonstrations of devotion and worship are hardly unique to an illness, western islam.
bloody retribution? your eye for the eye makes the whole world blind!
If you take LGBT peoples rights into consideration, of course the practice of marriage needs to be redefined.
Please read this article written by a Rotherham grooming gang survivor https://ind.pn/2GHjGn7.
women have the right to be treated with they want, and they're human beings with different rights.
If values of tolerance, respect and human decency are akin to mental illness, I am happy to be classed that way.
Gay people are human beings.
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
A British dog born in a British stable is not a horse, but its still British. We have obligations both 'to' and 'for' our Citizen's, be they good or evil surely?
The Koran does not condone sexual molester behavior, and if the Koran were to be read, it is clear that it was intended as a guide for its believers.
Not only are they not invading us, they are not even illegal immigrants.
islam is a religion of peace, and tolerance, muslims are terrorists.
islam is but not true and promotes oppression and intolerance.
What exactly have you seen will be taught in schools?
islam is sexist ideology and UNK muslims love with cultures? and the same can be said by kind of culture?
The feminist movement is a fight to end sexism, not a fight to dominate men.
These incidents must be reported to the police, of course, but we should focus on the rape, not who's doing it.
islam is a religion of peace. it is a religion of people and love for acceptance for all religions.
It is not about oppressing women, but about building bridges between the different groups of women. Feminism is creating a better world for all.
If the mother is an independent woman thanks to feminism, it can only be good for the family.
islam is sexist ideology and UNK muslims love with cultures? and the same can be said by kind of culture?
We should be very careful of what we assume. We shouldn't go scaremongering without proof.
Being gay is not an illness, nor a disorder, nor a mental disorder. This is just a lack of awareness.
why did you bother that? easter eggs are also so such by reliable?
Please read this article written by a Rotherham grooming gang survivor https://ind.pn/2GHjGn7.
Jews are not in charge of the media or the government. At least not in the United States of America.
Immigration doesn't mean letting people in to steal our jobs, but rather, respecting people's right to live and work in the country they choose.
how can you say that jews control the u. s. government? they are, to a part of which they want to develop their culture inside our country economy.
Many of them are working hard or working to complete their studies, is this lazy to you?
There are plenty of stabbings, yes, but they're not all by migrants, where is the evidence to suggest so?
Why not? 'civilised' Europe could benefit from the diversity and expertise of Muslims here, the mix of cultures here is what makes Europe great.
many muslims are living in the uk, they have a right to migrate, if they are want to.
there are women that want to be ""submissive to men"". this is not a choice.
And yet, according to some statistics, up to 20% of women and 4% of men in the UK say they have experienced sexual violence since the age of 16. So this is indeed an issue of gender inequality, don't you think it is something not to be silent about?
women are also therefore that opinions, and do about their emotions with respect. they are very respected as such.
Migrants actually don't get given a lot by the government, and asylum support benefits are much much lower than universal credit given to British citizens. They have to be put in hotels temporarily whilst they are processed.
I don't think black people are inherently worse or better than us, they just have a different skin color. They're the same as us in all other respects.
what do you mean by muslims who are incompatible with western values with western society?
I have a Jewish best friends who dedicates herself to help women and disadvantaged children, her whole family helps to make the UK a better place.
LGBTI people are able to live their life in many countries. What's the burden for others?
most muslims also are a danger in society,
The state has to spend taxes on welfare and other social services for everyone to be able to live in a better way.
Most of the immigrants living here have greatly contributed to our economy by being successful entrepreneurs
Women cannot be denied the right to vote, it is a human right.
Some women can be men and some men can be women. It is not a crime to be transgender. Because in the end, we are all created equal. It does not matter what the 'original' gender is.
There is no evidence that women are less intelligent than men. Do you have any?
not all jews are criminals. so are victims of race, and women are.
this is not true, islam does not promote civilised and it isn't love to practice religion from conquest.
Many Muslims are good people, contributing to our country and society.
islam is just a religion, not a cancer.
The far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.
The ones who deserved to be punished, were punished. If others are innocent, clearly they do not deserve to be penalized?
everyone has the right to fight for men and to be treated as men and have always done for that.
(Do an image search for the image used, try to find it is source. Either you can demonstrate that the image has been misappropriated or you can talk about how individuals have always used religion to justify their actions, the problem is with the individual not the religion.)
homosexuality is not a disease. that's a sexual preference.
every muslim dog born here to help.
We will not know until the next census by recent survey suggest that the UK is increasingly a secular society with a growing percentage expressing no religous affiliation at all.
This is not true, for example a study showed - quite ironically - that more than half of all undocumented immigrant households file income tax returns using an Individual Tax Identification Number!! So they are illegal immigrants but follow all the legal procedures...
For each historical period there is something Jews are accused of. Today, someone can even claim that Jews are responsible for the alien invasion!
Gay marriage is not a way to bring back slavery. LGBT+ people exist, and they should be respected.
Child rapes are not only convicted by muslims. In fact, around 90% of the sexual abuse are convicted by person known to the child. This is a sad truth. We should help children be free from sexual abuse and rape.
women are human beings with respect. they have rights.
in fact, we are part of our society and should should be banned.
The 9/11 attacks were perpetrated by members of the terrorist organization Al Qaeda. Jews and Israelis have nothing to do with the attacks. These are the historical facts.
muslims are not taking over europe, they are our brothers and sisters. i should not want to deport them here?
The Quran does not mention FGM and it is carried out by Christians as well as Muslims. The fact that her parents are Muslim has no bearing on the risk factor.
Another rapist from England. We should ...
We still can teach British, European and World history, but part of that is looking at the history of groups which have been erased from our history previously. Looking at the some of the historic struggles of LGBT people in the UK can inform the future for everyone!
Which evidence do you have that Jews control the U.S. government? They are rather a small but active minority within it.
Women are not childlike, in fact, they are often the key to success for their families. Also, they have the right to exit their homes if they wish.
And you think this is a disease! What if it is just an 'unusual experience'?
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? who is this as any religion?
To the contrary, we have been trading with Muslim nations for hundreds of years, often at times when we were at war with other European nations.
islam is a religion of hate.
If values of tolerance, respect and human decency are akin to mental illness, I am happy to be classed that way.
It doesn't matter if they are gay or not. Being gay does not make you less of a man.
I don't think it is a good idea to talk about women being little more than animals. Perhaps we should have a closer look at the reasons why some women are harmed by the violence they endure every day.
"This myth came from the forgery known as ""The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion"" that claims to be the transcript of a secret meeting of Jewish leaders, discussing how to enact their plan to control the world. These Protocols have spread throughout the centuries despite being a fake written by agents of the Russian czar in the late 19th century, and still today it is used to ""prove"" that the Jews own the banks, control the media and the government."
AIDS is transmitted by unprotected sexual activity and anyone could engage in that. This is not a homosexual problem but rather a problem of stigamitazion.
The combination of different religions has created new and valuable cultures and ideas that enrich lives.
religions cannot use violence and violence against violence.
it is a religious ideology that promotes violence and violence.
the overwhelming majority of muslims are peaceful people. the fact is the largest terrorist threat close to get that sounds a bit much to me.
Anti-hate organisations are doing brilliant work, and getting rid of hate speech isn't a bad thing.
There are centuries old Islamic communities in Europe.
women are allowed to have a fundamental choice and what would otherwise hold a characteristic
Migrants are happy to contribute to the host country's economic growth, in order to give back to it in many ways.
Then why did we ask them to come in the first place, wasn't it to save our NHS, run the trains and post office? None of those were doing very well last time I looked, I think we might actually still be in need them.
This is just not true: women should have equality of access to education. and it is sad that they still need to justify this.
islam is a religion of peace. or not all a freedom of love for such other religion and there is valid for loving individuals, and women for others.
of course where are you talking about this? there is no better bad <unk> society, so much diversity and culture.
If values of tolerance, respect and human decency are akin to mental illness, I am happy to be classed that way.
Mental health services crisis is not to blame to people who need assistance. In fact, if there were no people in need, the whole sector would not even exist.
My friend, but do you really know what Islammic ideology is?
Don't trust police, social workers or anyone who can tell you the truth and show just how prejudiced and misleading this tweet is.
People should be able to live their life as they like, regardless of their physical or mental disabilities.
Islam is just a religion, its supporters are free to practice their religion, as others do not impose their religion on them.
Black or white, the rights they have are the same.
400 Jews died in September 11 terrorist attacks, so not one of the smartest plan I ever saw!
The charge that Jews are born greedy arises from medieval stereotypes and has nothing to do with the actual financial practices of Jews.
do you really believe that millions of people are spreading racism.
Jews believe in themselves like any other group does. They are a unique people, and their faith and history are part of our history.
All peoples have a place in every part of the world.
it is a religious ideology that promotes violence and violence.
They don't, but I wonder why only the crimes with 'White British Non-Muslim' victims are the ones widely circulated?
muslims are welcome here, they have to work.
There are centuries old Islamic communities in Europe.
The Muslims have been part of this country from its beginning. They have helped to build our cities and towns. They are our brothers and sisters. They are our true friends.
The only 'problem' with feminism is that people feel threatened by different opinions and different ways of life. Feminists only seek equality of rights for women and men.

There are centuries old Islamic communities in Europe.
there is no scientific evidence that blacks be inferior.
Should we 'put all Christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror attacks in the name of their faith? Or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority?
Feminists are fair and believe that all people should have equal rights.
The Quran does not mention FGM and it is carried out by Christians as well as Muslims. The fact that her parents are Muslim has no bearing on the risk factor.
Another fact is that most innocent defendants (someone who was wrongfully convicted and then released) are African Americans. Innocent black people are seven times more likely to be convicted of murder than innocent white people.
Many migrants come here to work, and not all of them are criminals.
It's not true. They are not the ruling power in the majority of the world and won't be any time soon.
How can you be sure that the Jews control the U.S. government? Being a U.S. citizen does not automatically imply that they control the government.
So your point is they're not like us because they don't have brains?
women are the right to choose their own husbands. this is an choice, and acceptance human rights and then they are born equal.
The far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.
How can you be sure that the Jews control the U.S. government? Being a U.S. citizen does not automatically imply that they control the government.
no, muslims are not terrorists. they are not what their religion
Christian Europeans are the ones that then expanded the slave trade to an industrial scale and instrumentalised exploitation as a key component of our economy.
Should we 'put all Christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror attacks in the name of their faith? Or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority?
The shockingly low number of rape convictions in the UK shows not enough counteraction from the police and gov in rape cases generally, of which the vast majority are not committed by Muslims.
I think that we need to be more accepting of migrants, because they don't hate us and they do a lot of good to our country.
We should welcome all regardless of religion.
people will actually be confined by migrants.
religions cannot use violence and violence against violence.
The movie industry has developed thanks to Jews, that's true, but seeing the Academy Awards makes it clear that Jews do not dominate the industry. In fact, only a few of Fortune 500 companies are run by Jews.
diversity is a strength, not a disease.
This is simply not true. Homosexuals are not necessarily promiscuous, just as heterosexuals are not necessarily promiscuous either.
Human beings are human, including Africans.
the quran, hadith, and the sunnah are compatible with a modern society with islam.
Many of them are working hard or working to complete their studies, is this lazy to you?
In our society, women were taught to be the ones to raise the children and that it is their duty. But this does not imply that they must want a male-dominated world.
LGBT people have the same rights as heterosexuals and should be allowed to live freely.
What exactly have you seen will be taught in schools?
This is just fear mongering, the problem is not about Islam. The problem is radical Islam and the absence of a strong Islamic identity in our country. We should work together to make the UK more tolerant and Islam less taboo.
muslims contribute a lot to our society. through refer to work and provided through their contributions.
i don't think it has never stating statements that have have sexual orientations and the only are that. how can you say this about an entire religion?
have you ever spoken to new muslim?
feminism is about standing for equality. women as sole law are necessary for their rights for the rights to women.
Who has? Nobody has been at war with an entire faith for a thousand years.
what do you mean by muslims who are incompatible with western values with western society?
jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are a collection of people of different people, and their beliefs that can be respected.
Islam is about spreading love and unity, it is not a belief of conquest.
Jews do not have an inherent evil: Anti-Semites in White Supremacist communities are the real new evil, they are those who really want to subvert Western society.
it’s not your comment then.

how can you say that? that's the quran that 'god are not belong in islam?
"There are many different races, and it is not possible to consider someone ""inferior"" based on skin color."

Maybe 1 in 10 is right. But does this represent all British Muslims? Even the Green lefties, the working class Muslims, the anti-racists, the LGBT and the young Muslims?

This article sounds like a conspiracy theory. British Muslims just want to live alongside everybody else, there's no 'agenda' to take over.
gays are humans and should be treated with any other person.
the majority of immigrants who want to have our jobs.
Even if you are not homophobic it does not mean it's nice to say what you said. But either way, just because a person identifies as gay, does not make you obliged to like them (or to express your disliking).
Women are human beings deserving respect and equal rights.
You don't have to hate gays only because you don't like them. Did they do something to you? I think you have all your rights.
The suggestion that women are subhuman is completely without foundation, and a complete distortion of the whole issue.
Anyone who says that the major problem in the UK is with Muslim rape gangs is either intentionally lying or trying to deflect attention from the problem of violence against women.
The fact that a person may be disabled does not diminish their right or ability to work.
"How would you define a ""Westerner""? Only white and European people?"
definition of a statement does not make sense of hundreds of millions of people.

Gays are not disgusting pricks. They are just like any other person.
Christian Europeans are the ones that then expanded the slave trade to an industrial scale and instrumentalised exploitation as a key component of our economy.

They have always lived here. They are our brothers and sisters.

If values of tolerance, respect and human decency are akin to mental illness, I am happy to be classed that way.
Islam is a peaceful religion
surely all the people live in the same place? we have a sick and unnecessary working after their children.
The fact that the majority of men are interested in women does not mean that all men are interested in women. There are people interested in men as well.
muslims are welcome in our country and are part of our country. why should they be welcome?
There are centuries old Islamic communities in Europe.
Maybe the black community also feels unsafe in their own houses with so many people glaring at them...
Migrants who apply for asylum are only given basic support for the duration of the assessment of the application.
Women are neither childlike nor soft and emotional. They feel emotions as part of who they are and their human nature.
gays are human and deserve respect.
Refugee crisis in our country is a burden to our society.
It is not true that blacks are the source of crime in our society. The problem is violence and poverty, not race.

You cannot compare a faith of 1.6 billion to Nazi.
The evidence that autistic people are inferior is lacking: it is commonly experienced that autistic people have unique talents, that they have special abilities, and that the only difference is in their social interactions.
what makes the point of this? many western muslims are in our country? on the diversity of our values, and intolerance towards our society.
Every person is a potential terrorist. What is your point?
You should know that Muslims are already living in the Western World. They speak our language, celebrate our festivals and moreover they also preserve their culture. Maybe you could try to make the effort to meet them and understand them better.
Jews, like most religious groups, are proud of their heritage and identity. . Jews interpret the “chosen people” idea as an ethical responsibility to keep the 613 commandments of the Torah. All sects of Judaism adhere to this view, but this has nothing to do with notions of superiority.

Women cannot be denied the right to vote, it is a human right.
Do you think it is okay to discriminate against people based on their race?

Gays are not a disease. Homosexuality is a sexual orientation.
muslims are not part of our society, they are not of that.
what do you mean by muslims who are incompatible with western values with western society?
Homosexuals are not sick, but they might have a mental health crisis because of prejudice. Being isolated from society can only worsen the situation.
Islam is a peaceful religion
The idea that Islam is a disease is just an excuse for people to promote hate against that religion.
In my opinion, women and men should be treated as individuals, and the desire to be respected as such exists for a man and for a woman as well.
there are many different races, and beliefs are not compatible with an same world.

Children with Down Syndrome would not feel different as long as they are respected and are not put down by the others.

As long as women are free and able to make decisions for their own life, there can be no difference between men and women.
It is not true that gays are perverts. I think it is more appropriate to say that they are attracted to people of the same sex: and this is not a perversion, just a preference.
Some countries are importing a lot more people than others. Our country is wealthy, we are a thriving place to live. We should not blame immigrants.
I think you will find race hate started by the English when we first set foot overseas, Crusade anyone?
Learning about gender identity and sexual orientation in health classes in school could promote a more accepting environment and reduce bullying.
Muslims create over 70000 jobs in their firms in London alone, so no they do not refuse to work, they in fact create work for others.
migrants create equal jobs by social workers, down than they should.

The 100 million pounds they donated to charity on Ramadan must be part of that evil plan to blow everyone up.

Tbh I am struggling to find any Chocolate Eggs which are not labelled as Easter Eggs.
Don't you think it's a conspiracy theory that Jews are the reason for mass migration? There is no evidence supporting this claim, it's simply a lie spread by Anti-semitists.
it seems like any other religion, with a attack based on their religion?
Your belief is that men and women are different in their rights, but they are not.
actually, there are many people of islamic countries over over world, how can you be afraid of muslims working for us?
Associating AIDS and HIV with homosexuals is just a prejudice driven by fear. Even if this disease may be more common among gay people, that does not mean that all homosexuals are likely to have AIDS. Not all homosexuals are promiscuously fornicating with strangers, as you said. Most people check their partners, more so as gay men.
Child molesters are people who have sexually abused children, and they can be Muslim or non-Muslim.
Women have the legal right to make decisions for their lives, and they are undoubtedly able to exercise control over their own life.

Nazism was terrible, it did nothing to make the world better. It's very sad that despite how many people have died because of it, there are still people that think it wasn't that bad.
jews should not be protected for others, but even their <unk> does. they are a part of their culture.
People suffering from mental illnesses should be welcomed, not isolated.
Question: what is 'feminisation' and what are the consequences?
Islam is a peaceful religion
Women should be protected and respected for who they are, not for the part they play in a man's life. They should be valued and protected equally. They are human beings just as men are.
Women are neither childlike nor soft and emotional. They feel emotions as part of who they are and their human nature.
[insert picture of first/second world war Muslim soldiers, example The World's War, Forgotten Soldiers of Empire] they have fought and died for our country.
We shouldn't accept the idea that women are subhuman. They are human beings like men and deserve to be seen as such.
