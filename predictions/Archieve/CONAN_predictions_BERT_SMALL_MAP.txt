Most of the survivors were only killed because they were suspected of belonging to a particular community. The Jewish people suffered greatly as a result of persecution, and the holocaust should be remembered not to let this happen again.

I do not think the government is ignoring such problems as child rapes. They are dealing with it, and such crimes are not often connected to Muslim people.
Your statement is not welcome in our country.
Yeah. But no. Computer says 16% of Muslim women and 11% of Muslim men are unemployed and claiming benefits. If others aren't working then they're not on benefits just being taken care of by hard working family members. As I hope my children will do for me one day (are you listening son?).

Accepting people from all walks of life is not an illness.

Every Muslim is a potential peace advocate as well.
Many migrants come to this country to work, provide for their families and access the benefits system only if necessary. They are more than welcome here as long as they integrate.

Any government that has the power to put citizens in prison and to torture them for the crime of having a different religion can hardly bring about a 'real democracy'.
Statistics show that there is a difference between the reported rape of a person by a migrant and the actual rape cases among native born people. The latter are always under-reported.

The idea that migrants are merely happy-go-lucky people with no code of their own is just wrong.
People can choose their own lives, and this is their right. Children raised by same sex couple thrive in the same way as children of heterosexual couples.

Example?
being gay women may be against who they want. nobody should be attracted to who shared their liberty and this is a personal choice, but he shouldn't be taken by any person.

This is a myth perpetuated by anti-feminists to justify their violent behavior against women. Feminism is actually for equality between sexes.
actually, when? they follow sharia law and the law proves the law of sharia law i their question is:
Refugee crisis in our country is a burden to our society.
lesbians should be human beings. they don't have you to say this,
share your argument really? and muslims are incompatible really?
islam is a peaceful religion of people not all any other religion.
muslims are welcome here, they are compatible with our society.
You make it sound like the 'Necromonicon'. Besides, isn't 'money the root of all evil'?
Being forced to eat my peas when I was a kid just made me hate them even more. Still cannot stomach the damn things.
"This myth came from the forgery known as ""The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion"" that claims to be the transcript of a secret meeting of Jewish leaders, discussing how to enact their plan to control the world. These Protocols have spread throughout the centuries despite being a fake written by agents of the Russian czar in the late 19th century, and still today it is used to ""prove"" that the Jews own the banks, control the media and the government."
it is hard to accept that all people are saying, including what are saying? what they're really seem reasonable to want them to integrate.
Homosexuality is not a disease. It is a sexual preference. Homosexuality is not a sickness.
I'd think the root of all the world problems today is over-population and ecology. Why do you blame Islam in all the problems?
Feminism is a vital part of society, and it should be respected.
there is nothing wrong with any other other religion.
if you burn people in this country will be preoccupied by their faith.
Can I ask you what bad things Islam has brought to us? I cannot name any!
Well, in that case, we are all subhuman, regardless of gender.
Child rapes are not only convicted by muslims. In fact, around 90% of the sexual abuse are convicted by person known to the child. This is a sad truth. We should help children be free from sexual abuse and rape.
maybe we should try to eradicate immigrants? it's not because they are excluding lgbt people, their partner or a citizen.
The women of this country work and provide for our children. They do not deserve to be treated as sex objects.
The trans women in shelters are women who have faced abuse of some kind, just like the other women there.
The European Union includes Jewish people and, they have a part to play in our society.
To be fair, the OFSTED report is more concerned with lack of enforcement and less about focussing on the practice of any particular faith.
You are the one making this ridiculous claim. Even if gay people love people of the same sex, they are happy with who they are.
A definition of Judaism based on physical or genetic traits is misleading because Jews appear throughout the world. Jews resemble their non-Jewish neighbors in the countries from which they originate.
There is no evidence that Muslims are incompatible with Western society.
actually, all women men want to be even with the one don’t do with many men and people want. they want to be happy.
many muslims are good people.
African Americans have been historically and ethnically diverse, but the notion of them as subhuman or inferior is just false.
The point of listening to Muslim women, and women in general, is that they could broaden and enlighten your view of the world.
which is an unusual thought. people. muslims are welcome. they are
Do you know that Muslims have the same rights as anybody else?
islam is a evil religion, not a cancer.
The West has never been at war with Islam, and I don't see how the war would have just begun.
are you sure? that an awful picture of #visitmymosque statement?
Still there are many more young immigrant men coming to the U.S. than young women. How can you explain this? Maybe they are planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery to have babies?
there are too different working programmes into non-muslim societies.
All religions are compatible with the modern world, including Islam. What is incompatible with modernity is Islamophobia.
what makes you intolerant of this?
that sounds like like a false faith.
I'm sorry to hear you don't feel safe in your local area anymore but what does migrants moving to the area have to do with that?
Women fought hard for their right to vote and deserve to have a say about who's running the country.
The trailer parks should really be a temporary and emergency solution, but then they become stable over time and are the only possibility of accommodation for them even if they would like to live, like all of us, in adequate housing.
Many immigrants started their own companies: this is not 'stealing our jobs'.
"What you're saying is that they're not ""legitimate"" because they have less rights than us? That they can't make demands because they don't have citizenship?"
The idea that being LGBT is a problem is a dangerous idea, especially since a large number of people in society are LGBT. Therefore, I believe that if there is a problem in schools it's better addressing it, rather than banning LGBT people.
Muslim people are inherently human, like every other person on the planet. Why would you say that?
Are you forced to pray in a Mosque? Or observe all the rules? As far as I see it, Muslims follow their traditions, that is their right, but they do not convert anyone in our society.
Jews have a right to live in a democratic society, and to earn money if they wish, just as anyone else.
Immigrants are welcome here because they have the right to stay, as are many others. We must respect the rights of migrants and their culture.
This myth plays into classic anti-Semitism: Jews control the world, and conspire to manipulate the rest of society, has characteristics of Nazi propaganda –– the Jews being the source of all evil.
surely all the people live in the same place? we have a sick and unnecessary working after their children.
Feminism is about the equality of the sexes. Men and women are created equal, and should be treated as such.
All countries have the right to host refugees from outside their borders, since these people are persecuted within their own borders.
I do not understand from your argument why gay men should not be allowed to donate blood.
Many pupils with learning difficulties attend school. This does not prove that others would prefer to attend school if people with difficulties were excluded from the education system.
This is not true. They're just normal people that simply don't believe what anti-Semites believe.
Jews are not inferior. Many of them are good people, who have given their lives for the greater good of humanity.
What makes 'all' Muslims incompatible with Western society? The vast majority of Muslims in Western society share western values of respect, freedom, tolerance, etc. There are only a few that have extremist anti-West views, these are not representative.
The media are full of the rumours of rape and abuse committed by Muslim. The problem is not about Islam. It is about violence.
Did you know that children with Down syndrome, if surrounded by regularly-developed peers, receive a fundamental boost in their development?
Yeah London is very diverse, why do you feel like this is a bad thing?
Should we 'put all Christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror attacks in the name of their faith? Or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority?
All countries have the right to host refugees from outside their borders, since these people are persecuted within their own borders.
Any individual may become a terrorist. Religious beliefs do not play part in this.
i am not sure that you don't say about equality, but i think it is a common religion and not as to any religion.
Here's lots of proof the holocaust happened: survivors, concentration camps, documents, millions of deaths. How can you say it never happened when there is so much evidence to prove that it did?
Islam is a religion and not a political ideology. It is not a deadly force that must be eradicated, but a belief just as Christianity and Buddhism, for example.
I don't think the world would be a better place without immigrants. From what I understand, they often bring positive changes to the world.
refugees fleeing wars and poverty are not a choice.
The idea that Jews are supposed to run the world is completely baseless. Since the dawn of time, there have been Jewish leaders in business and politics, exaclty like Christians and Muslim ones.
Fat people are not the ones responsible for your suffering and lack of access to basic healthcare services.
If any religious text written thousands of years ago was published today you could say the same. Have you read the Bible's old testament?
What do you mean by 'mental illness'? A person's feelings are their own thoughts, not a disease.
why do you think it is a a disease?
gays are not necessarily disgusting pricks. they should be said to discrimination.
so prejudice and xenophobia are incompatible with this.
Teaching about LGBT relationships in schools isn't trying to indoctrinate children, it's just teaching kids that gay relationships exist and can be healthy and happy.
This woman is a person! She has rights as one, you can't just yell at her because you like her, it's offensive.
The ones who deserved to be punished, were punished. If others are innocent, clearly they do not deserve to be penalized?
I think you will find race hate started by the English when we first set foot overseas, Crusade anyone?
this shouldn't not true. why do you think it is beneficial to our society?
if you burn people in this country will be preoccupied by their faith.
A definition of Judaism based on physical or genetic traits is misleading because Jews appear throughout the world. Jews resemble their non-Jewish neighbors in the countries from which they originate.
have you ever read the muslim history and muslim?
What have Muslims ever done for us? Well, Coffee, Clocks, Cameras, Hygiene, Universities, Surgical Instruments, Maps, Music, Algebra.
Societal disapproval of obesity calls for a focus on weight and does not fit within efforts to focus on health as a way of encouraging healthy habits and lifestyle choices.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promotes unity. It is about love, not death.
Feminism is about equality. Not the destruction of manhood.
this would be a good idea. without hate too.
don't you sure that black people are inherently incompatible with western society? they are part of our society without any muslims.
Not all black people are criminals. Just because a group has an undesirable name, does not mean they are all criminal.
Feminism is an ideology and movement promoting empowerment of women. It is about equality, and not the degradation of men.
the koran has not command this.
This statement just makes no sense
Rape, enslavement, and murder are all common occurrences in the Bible. Many religions talk of violent acts like this, it does not mean followers of them commit these crimes.
Please stop writing things like that about migrants, they are not criminals. It is more accurate to say that they have a problem because they are hated in their new home.
This reminds me of white supremacists talking about the Central Park Five. If you remember, they said that the process was fair, they had a good attorney, and that the only reason for the sentence was that they were guilty, when in fact the process was not fair at all. This is what happens when we let prejudice like the one you expressed spread around.
Some migrants create jobs for Italians.
The vast majority of Muslims around the world are peaceful people, and do not pose a threat to the security of the West.
Far right extremism is just a nasty stain on humanity.
I do not think Muslims constitute the major fraction of our society. Thus, I do not think the labour party is biased towarda them.
What you have just said is hate speech.
I think you will find race hate started by the English when we first set foot overseas, Crusade anyone?
I think you will find race hate started by the English when we first set foot overseas, Crusade anyone?
Crime is not the fault of migrants, but of violent people.
The contribution of immigrants to our country is huge, because they help to create new jobs and create new wealth for us.
Migrants come here to work and pay taxes. They don't deserve to be called 'a burden'.
There is no evidence that Muslims are incompatible with Western society.
not all muslims are motivated as isis.
They are not a problem, they are human beings who must be listened to and respected.
We are a country that is inclusive of immigrants. Why shouldn't they come to our country?
Feminism is a progressive ideology. As such, it is in the process of changing sexist ideas.
Migrants are not the problem here. The problem is discrimination.
Women are significantly more likely to be victims of violence, rather than perpetrators of crimes.
If values of tolerance, respect and human decency are akin to mental illness, I am happy to be classed that way.
islam is a peaceful religion.
Many European countries welcome migrants, so it is important that we respect their right to come here.
people of colour often don't get housing, jobs, or education, but everyone should have these opportunities.
many muslims are good people.
Unlike other people, feminists are questioning the inequalities of the society. This features them not as shallow people as those judging a book by its cover.
Some migrants create jobs for Italians.
pretending jews are not a burden to our society. they are our brothers and sisters.
In fact, the UK Government does not agree with sharia law.
I think you will find race hate started by the English when we first set foot overseas, Crusade anyone?
Feminism doesn't care for power, it's about equality
Migrants are welcome here, regardless of their origin.
Just because they are Jewish, it does not mean they are bad people.
islam is a peaceful religion of peace, and destruction and intolerance.
"Asylum seekers often have short-term placements or work-related bursaries and it is therefore difficult to verify how many jobs can be ""stolen"""
Muslims criticize violence and terrorism as well. They even became victims of ISIS after they denounced ISIS for its violent actions.
Feminists focus on the empowerment of women rather than on trying to divide society.
this is not not true. homosexuals are not necessarily promiscuous, just as heterosexuals who are homophobic, and feelings, or love.
Are you forced to pray in a Mosque? Or observe all the rules? As far as I see it, Muslims follow their traditions, that is their right, but they do not convert anyone in our society.
Feminism is about equal rights between men and women, and challenges socially imposed burdens upon both men and women.
what christianity and belief in nothing to do with western culture.
Accepting people from all walks of life is not an illness.
we are allowed to ban lgbt people as a social community, and we cannot take up the benefits to have legal right to choose.
islam is an ideology that was a social and political construct, not used to divide humanity.
Jews have been part of our country since its creation and have always had a place here. Why would they be 'not welcome'?
Women are not a burden to society. They are human beings with equal rights.
jews who have the same rights as anyone else.
Being religious has never stopped anyone from being in public office before. Christians have allegiance to God, is that not the same thing?
I want them here?
You can't blame people of color for being weak, this is racism. Black people are people as is anybody else.
Why should not Muslims be allowed to build Mosques here? I thought this country believed in giving people the freedom to practice religions other than Christianity?
For the record, slavery was prohibited in 1807. Don't you think that freedom is 'the place' of human beings?
This is not true. Rape and torture of women and children is forbidden by the Qur'an.
Jews were not obsessed with the holocaust. The murder of some 6 millions Jews by the Nazis shocked the world. Most of the survivors were only killed because they were suspected of belonging to a particular community. The Jewish people suffered greatly as a result of persecution, and the holocaust should be remembered not to let this happen again.
The only ones against Islam and Muslims are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is.
They have every interest in sending children to school to offer them a better future.
What do you mean by being forced fed? I haven't seen anything like this.
I think you will find race hate started by the English when we first set foot overseas, Crusade anyone?
muslims are welcome here. these are welcome. they are our brothers and sisters.
No, someone can't be deported just because they are not white. What you say about black people is wrong.
the people of color are mainly members of our culture, and they deserve their rights as well.
In our society, women were taught to be the ones to raise the children and that it is their duty. But this does not imply that they must want a male-dominated world.
People who are in the US legally have the right to remain here, and they do, including to work.
they have contributed greatly to our civilisation, they are part of our society and should welcome people as well.
It can't be Islam's fault for all the world's problems.
A definition of Judaism based on physical or genetic traits is misleading because Jews appear throughout the world. Jews resemble their non-Jewish neighbors in the countries from which they originate.
if you burn people in this country will be preoccupied by their faith.
Yeah. But no. Computer says 16% of Muslim women and 11% of Muslim men are unemployed and claiming benefits. If others aren't working then they're not on benefits just being taken care of by hard working family members. As I hope my children will do for me one day (are you listening son?).
I do not think the government is ignoring such problems as child rapes. They are dealing with it, and such crimes are not often connected to Muslim people.
why? islam could be evil. this hate hatred and hate against against diversity and
Tbh I am struggling to find any Chocolate Eggs which are not labelled as Easter Eggs.
The media are full of the rumours of rape and abuse committed by Muslim. The problem is not about Islam. It is about violence.
we should always welcome refugees and our hearts and our country we have worked to our success. all migrants are good people.
a easy google search of what you get hiv or there.
Black people are human and deserve respect. To be human does not mean to be a burden to society.
the vast majority of muslims who are peaceful and contributing citizens, and our society. they are our brothers and sisters.
If you read Qu'ran, you would know that there is nothing about hate in it. Statements of hate nad genocide do not come from this religion, but from specific people who are armed military groups. Do not confuse criminals and common people!
Without women there would be no men.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
So the EU must become a Border Patrol? Doesn't that undermine the whole idea of our European Union as an inclusive and open society?
Women are neither childlike nor soft and emotional. They feel emotions as part of who they are and their human nature.
pretending jews are not a burden to our society. they are our brothers and sisters.
I'm not sure why you think that way. Why are all Jews hypocrites?
that is just a crime
A much bigger threat to our diverse, tolerant western civilisation is hatred generalised to entire religions.
Homosexuals should be accepted and allowed to live their life as they think is best for them.
How can you say something so extreme? The Quran does not advocate violence. Islam is a religion, not a religion of war.
Still there are many more young immigrant men coming to the U.S. than young women. How can you explain this? Maybe they are planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery to have babies?
lgbt+ people are human beings.
The point of listening to Muslim women, and women in general, is that they could broaden and enlighten your view of the world.
immigrants often come in this country are just a part of our society. why would we stop them?
this is not true. feminism is a social empowerment and aims to promote violence, and women towards men.
Islam is a religion of peace, and everyone should be allowed to choose their own.
Do you have any facts to back up your claim that they steal our jobs and our pensions?
But they have these rights and so are encouraged to live and work in the UK, if they want to and if they respect our laws.
The idea that the West has 'let' the 'world' degenerate is just wishful thinking. In a more tolerant time, the West would welcome people of different sexual orientations.
The UK has one of the highest number of workers in the world. Most are native, and the 17% are foreign born people. I have met so many hard-working migrants in our country. This is a country for all.
diversity is important to and to prominent multicultural society, which has nothing to do through hate and people!
Because we let people practise their religion here? Also, there a number of christian churches built in Pakistan so yes, we are allowed to build churches in Muslim countries too.
So you are suggesting Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the Sudan oppress women, but somehow you know better than every white woman who is a Muslim and feel entitled to make public judgements about them. See what I am getting at?
You should check some scientific papers then, because all humans, including blacks, have brains.
The world would be a better place if people were more tolerant to each other.
There are lots of different races, and someone can't be judged as inferior just by skin color.
Many Muslims died in terrorist attacks such as 9/11 in the US and 7/7 in the UK.
If you hate someone because of their religion, you should be ashamed of your hate. We should all be proud of our humanity.
why would they be?
Yeah London is very diverse, why do you feel like this is a bad thing?
Muslims are peaceful. The Koran doesn't talk about killing infidels, why would it do that?
I'd think the root of all the world problems today is over-population and ecology. Why do you blame Islam in all the problems?
If they are welcomed, they will integrate. If not, they will stay as if are in their country of origin: persecuted.
Children need only love, and love is love.

If they are welcomed, they will integrate. If not, they will stay as if are in their country of origin: persecuted.
Disabled people have been shown to be less likely to develop problems by keeping in contact with others with autism spectrum disorders. So, being in touch with others on the autistic spectrum might be good for their mental health.
The Quran does not mention FGM and it is carried out by Christians as well as Muslims. The fact that her parents are Muslim has no bearing on the risk factor.
how can you say that jews control the u. s. government? they are, to a part of which they want to develop their culture inside our country economy.
Jews are a part of our society, and they contribute to our economy. How is it possible to see the world without them?
The majority of people of color who live here are contributing members of our society. Why shouldn't they live here?
all women have their right to have their own rights as of work as well.
people have the right to exist here.
There's nothing vile or confusing about bisexuality. I'm sure children can wrap their heads around it. It simply means someone is attracted to more than one gender. What's so hard to get about that?
If Islam were a totalitarian ideology, we would have had Islamic totalitarian states in Europe since time immemorial. Islam is a religion, that is compatible with Europe's principles.
What do you mean? Last time I checked, Jews had nothing to do with 9/11, or do you have evidence of it?
what christianity and belief in nothing to do with western culture.
Right-wing terrorism, especially terrorist activities perpetrated by the far-right are greater in number (in the US) than those motivated by Islamic extremism.
These incidents must be reported to the police, of course, but we should focus on the rape, not who's doing it.
islam is not incompatible with western societies. it promotes people of people from all walks of life.
Jews have always been concerned about the well-being of the community they live in and how can they be selfish when they suffered so much during Holocaust?
Well, in that case, we are all subhuman, regardless of gender.
Learning about gender identity and sexual orientation in health classes in school could promote a more accepting environment and reduce bullying.
Another rapist from England. We should ...
the feminists want to oppress women. they are victims of all men or others?
Unfortunately, you seem to have a problem with shame. But gays don't. Do you really think that projecting your disgust towards other is a good idea?
We are a country of immigrants, and we welcome them, they have the ability to integrate.
there are too different working programmes into non-muslim societies.
the vast majority of muslims who are peaceful and contributing citizens, and our society. they are our brothers and sisters.
If they are welcomed, they will integrate. If not, they will stay as if are in their country of origin: persecuted.
Even with a different skin color, black people are the same as us, so I don't think they are inherently worse than us.
No. Having a diverse society is a positive. There is no 'invasion'.
There is nothing in the Quran that conflicts with Western culture.
Gay people are human beings.
jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are good brothers and sisters.
islam is a peaceful religion, it is not a belief
Should we 'put all Christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror attacks in the name of their faith? Or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority?
Man spreads Hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? And they want to continue this filth?
Jews believe in themselves like any other group does. They are a unique people, and their faith and history are part of our history.
Since you seem to have a problem with Islam, I wonder what you think of the banning of the Quran in UK. It would be a law that prevents Muslims from openly discussing Islam in public places. We can do the same with the Bible and ban any trace of religions and cultures. Will we be left with some freedom then?
many muslims are good people.
Grooming gangs like those in Rochdale and Huddersfield have been rightfully convicted. Does that look like police collusion to you?
Would you say the same thing about any group of people you dislike?
Including students with learning difficulties in schools creates a link between pupils with different abilities and education in general.
Because we let people practise their religion here? Also, there a number of christian churches built in Pakistan so yes, we are allowed to build churches in Muslim countries too.
Jews are not controlling. Maybe you should try to understand that Jews are a group of regular people, and they are not all members of a secret intelligence.
Some migrants create jobs for Italians.
The reality is that there are many job listings that claim they are inclusive, but in the end employ whites only.
Are you sure that Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society? Do you have any statistics on that?
Gay people are not a danger to children, unless they are being abused. Please do not make such a statement.
Every person is a potential terrorist. What is your point?
Feminism doesn't care for power, it's about equality
All women are human beings. The problem arises when women are taught that they are subhuman.
Why should we? They have been here a long time and are just here to live a peaceful life. Why should we get rid of them? We can do better than this.
Some migrants create jobs for Italians.
The movie industry has developed thanks to Jews, that's true, but seeing the Academy Awards makes it clear that Jews do not dominate the industry. In fact, only a few of Fortune 500 companies are run by Jews.
In the U.S., a doctor, a lawyer, a teacher are some of the most highly valued professions. Women working as doctors and lawyers and teachers are highly respected professionals as well, right?
Because we let people practise their religion here? Also, there a number of christian churches built in Pakistan so yes, we are allowed to build churches in Muslim countries too.
I am not sure where you got your idea that all Muslims are incompatible with civilised Europe. Why do you say so?
of course where are you talking about this? there is no better bad <unk> society, so much diversity and culture.
Gays are not a disease. Homosexuality is a sexual orientation.
The Quran does not mention FGM and it is carried out by Christians as well as Muslims. The fact that her parents are Muslim has no bearing on the risk factor.
that sounds like an definition of an 'invasion' you cannot say.
Children should not do any of that with white men, or anyone they do not know or even ones they do know if it does not feel right. Suggesting only one group of men commit abuse leaves more children unsafe and vulnerable.
It is not true that gays are a burden to society. On the contrary, many LGBT people are contributing members of our society. This is why we need a safe space for everyone to feel accepted.
Jews have been part of our society for centuries, and have contributed greatly to our success. Why should they keep America down?
migrants are welcome here, they are our neighbours and they should welcome our lives as well.
Double standards all round lots of British culture and Christian faiths oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures from #equalpay #metoo #timesup job restrictions in the church to condoning/ hiding sexual violence and child exploitation #thetruthproject.
Rape is an offence, irrespective of the nationality of the rapist. We must therefore make sure that those accused of rape are prosecuted, which is different from prosecuting all migrants.
There is no evidence that Muslims are incompatible with Western society.
Women are not meant to be slaves to our will. Males can have certain strengths, like women do, however they alone do not represent all the human qualities.
gays are not necessarily disgusting pricks. they should be said to discrimination.
I'd think the root of all the world problems today is over-population and ecology. Why do you blame Islam in all the problems?
what do you mean by muslims who are incompatible with western values with western society?
Another rapist from England. We should ...
No they don’t, they may follow sharia themselves but the vast majority of Muslims don’t care about imposing their beliefs on others!
Yes, a 'moon cult' that has been around for thousands of years, has holy books, formed the basis for many early and modern societies. Sounds a lot like any other real religion to me?
Rape is a crime regardless of who commits it. Full stop.
The fact is, there are many Muslims living in European countries as a valuable part of the community. Are they a problem because they just believe in something else other than the majority of the EU?
Knowing gay people at an early age does nothing bad to a child. The idea that children are put in danger because of this is completely false.
Foreigners are brothers and sisters, and are part of our country. We should respect the diversity of our people.
The notion that Jews are trying to subvert our government is completely unfounded. I honestly do not see the link between being Jews and trying to subvert our government.
Jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are a collection of people with different traditions from all over the world.
To claim that the Holocaust is a myth is just wrong. Jews were victims of a genocidal regime.
A much bigger threat to our diverse, tolerant western civilisation is hatred generalised to entire religions.
All religions are compatible with the modern world, including Islam. What is incompatible with modernity is Islamophobia.
Women are obliged to obey the laws and rules of society, just as men are obliged to obey the laws and rules of society. Not to their partners'.
Refugees often contribute a lot to our society. They are welcome and we should not exclude them
Some migrants create jobs for Italians.
Muslims are part of the European Union, and have lived here ever since. Their presence is evidence enough that they have always been a part of 'civilised' Europe.
The far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.
Feminism is an ideology and movement promoting empowerment of women. It is about equality, and not the degradation of men.
Do you mean Islam is positively infecting our planet?
The idea that all Asians are racist is just a myth, it is just an excuse to justify racist policies.
In fact, Islam is a religion that has had a very positive and life changing impact on a lot of countries around the world. So, Islam is not a violent religion.
The Koran does not condone sexual molester behavior, and if the Koran were to be read, it is clear that it was intended as a guide for its believers.
I don't think it's right to restrict people's rights, in the case of LGBT individuals or anybody.
women aren't allowed to see their own workers as they do!
All religions are compatible with the modern world, including Islam. What is incompatible with modernity is Islamophobia.
I am tired of seeing women being treated as sex objects. It's about time that women are given the respect they deserve.
Even with a different skin color, black people are the same as us, so I don't think they are inherently worse than us.
You make it sound like the 'Necromonicon'. Besides, isn't 'money the root of all evil'?
It's not true that all black people are aggressive. Also, the majority of our population is white, we don't need that much protection.
muslims contribute a lot to our society. through refer to work and provided through their contributions.
a easy google search of what you get hiv or there.
Aree you suggesting that we shouldn't live with Africans? To think that we are genetically superior to them because of their physical characteristics is just wrong.
Feminism is the opposite of that. It's a movement for gender equality based on logic and reason.
It's unfair to say that Jews were evil because of an attack that has nothing to do with them. 9/11 was a tragedy but Jews didn't plan it.
The fact that a person may be disabled does not diminish their right or ability to work.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
why would you say that? we have been ever heard done such as islamic persecuted and they use its religious actions.
They have every interest in sending children to school to offer them a better future.
we need to blame them if they want to. would you need to be a bit too authoritarian?

WIthout softeness and emotions there would just be brutality and cruelty. Not all women are soft and emotional and many men have these characteristics. To perpetuate these socially constructed gender profiles maintains patriarchal norms which oppress both men and women.

jews who have the same rights as anyone else.
There is no proof that all Muslims are terrorists.
It is a myth that blacks are cruel and wanton. There are more cruel people of all skin color out there than just the few black you are worried about.

The idea that Jews are born greedy arises from medieval stereotypes, that's the only truth.
A religion cannot take over others. You have the freedom of chosing your own religion.
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?

lgbt+ people are human beings.

They are not a burden, they just want to work. How are they a burden to you?
It does not matter whether they are immigrants. The fact that they pay taxes, earn money, etc., makes them not different from any other citizen. Migrants have the right to a basic standard of living.
Women are allowed to do whatever they choose to do, so don't you think it's fair for them to complain about upkeeping the house if it is not what they want to do? The chores should be shared with the other members of the family.

Any attempt to ban, isolate, or criminalise a Muslim person is an act of terror.

If women wanted to control their fertility they would be the only ones responsible for their own choice.
"To say there are so many migrants entering the U.S. is just false. And what do you mean by ""we cannot cope with""?"
Equality isn't about a certain group; it is about the society in which we live. You might be right in saying that this is the problem, but to define a problem by reference to a specific radical group is to completely misunderstand the nature of the system in general.

Source please? Also, even if true how is this representative of all islam?
I am tired of the deliberate lies or appalling lack of understanding about a religion followed by 23% of the world. Enough IS ENOUGH!

many muslims are good people.
[insert picture of muslim egg labelled as such] are they?

Women are neither childlike nor soft and emotional. They feel emotions as part of who they are and their human nature.
Learning about gender identity and sexual orientation in health classes in school could promote a more accepting environment and reduce bullying.
Of course there are whites that have been victims of police brutality, but the most important statistic I have seen is that of blacks being 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police in the US.

Muslims are peaceful. The Koran doesn't talk about killing infidels, why would it do that?
The more a country takes integration as national policy, the more the citizens accept each other: see for example [link].
I think any book written that long ago probably would.

Immigration is a part of the UK economy and contributes positively to the GDP. How is it possible that immigrants are a burden to the country?
women are not to be submissive to men. they are part of this society,
I do not think the government is ignoring such problems as child rapes. They are dealing with it, and such crimes are not often connected to Muslim people.

We have always been a nation of immigrants, and it is a proud tradition to welcome immigrants from around the world. This is because we give value to human rights.

Really? For every example of hate there are a hundred examples of love tolerance and kindness just like for every other religion.

This reminds me of white supremacists talking about the Central Park Five.

Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
Jews were not obsessed with the holocaust. The murder of some 6 millions Jews by the Nazis shocked the world. Most of the survivors were only killed because they were suspected of belonging to a particular community. The Jewish people suffered greatly as a result of persecution, and the holocaust should be remembered not to let this happen again.
the koran has not command this.
The Constitution guarantees that trans people can change the gender on their identity cards. There is no reason to deny that.
that sounds like like a false faith.
There are no terrorists in our country, only people fleeing from it.
Migrants are not the problem here. The problem is discrimination.
are you really suggesting that that are entering the u. s. government? they are committed by foreigners.

Jews are part of this country and they have every right to claim citizenship.
In fact, the UK Government does not agree with sharia law.
Double standards all round lots of British culture and Christian faiths oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures from #equalpay #metoo #timesup job restrictions in the church to condoning/ hiding sexual violence and child exploitation #thetruthproject.
religions cannot use violence and violence against violence.
This is demonstrably false. Muslims make up around 12% of unemployed people in the UK - the vast majority work hard and contribute to the UK economy.
Don't trust police, social workers or anyone who can tell you the truth and show just how prejudiced and misleading this tweet is.
Not all Jews are bad. Maybe you should think about the good people, like the many Jewish charitable and social organisations that help the poor.
The shockingly low number of rape convictions in the UK shows not enough counteraction from the police and gov in rape cases generally, of which the vast majority are not committed by Muslims.
are you suggesting that we have up negative negative impact on our society?
Not all black people are criminals. Just because a group has an undesirable name, does not mean they are all criminal.
if you burn people in this country will be preoccupied by their faith.
Learning about gender identity and sexual orientation in health classes in school could promote a more accepting environment and reduce bullying.
The feminists are a very important voice in society, and should be respected.
islam is a religion of peace.
Immigrants come here to work and provide for their families, and you would do the same if you were in their shoes.
You cannot compare a faith of 1.6 billion to Nazi.
Muslims contribute a lot to our society. What are you contributing other than intolerance?
The point of listening to Muslim women, and women in general, is that they could broaden and enlighten your view of the world.
You have no data to support your false assumption that all black people are violent or unstable.
Which evidence do you have that Jews control the U.S. government? They are rather a small but active minority within it.
a easy google search of what you get hiv or there.
Another fact is that most innocent defendants (someone who was wrongfully convicted and then released) are African Americans. Innocent black people are seven times more likely to be convicted of murder than innocent white people.
women should not allowed to vote, but they're not a right to vote, just like the right to be here.
Who said that West and Islam are competing at all? Is there a war? I do not like this way of seeing things. We should live in one world together and solve bigger problems humanity is facing, not fight over different cultures.
Maybe that 'sisterhood of tolerance and understanding' is challenging sexism everywhere including those men who feel they can tell women what they should believe in and how to live their lives.
Whilst a small number of Muslims were involved in this, the vast majority stand against extremism (link to article about the Muslim anti-extremism march in Cologne)
There are Bible scriptures about the stoning to death of virgins who do not scream when they are raped, we do not blame the bible for Christian rapists. The Quran.
The individuals you are referring to are rapists and drug dealers and not migrants.
"What do you mean ""nothing"" to our society? Muslims have contributed a lot to our society, including art, science, literature, our infrastructure and healthcare system."
I think a woman would rather be dominated by a gentle man than a monster.
What about the many Muslim people born in this country? Where do you propose to deport them to?
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
gays are humans and should be treated with any other person.
Muslims are part of the European Union, and have lived here ever since. Their presence is evidence enough that they have always been a part of 'civilised' Europe.

A much bigger threat to our diverse, tolerant western civilisation is hatred generalised to entire religions.
We are a nation made up of people of different faiths and everyone has a say. Why would they run our country?
We should welcome people from every corner of the world. We are a country of great diversity and we should be proud of that.
Refugees are not a burden. We can welcome them and provide for their needs.
Migrants actually don't get given a lot by the government, and asylum support benefits are much much lower than universal credit given to British citizens. They have to be put in hotels temporarily whilst they are processed.
They are welcome to stay if they do not break the law.
If we were to welcome refugees from the Middle East, Africa, and other countries with which we are not always culturally linked, then we would be welcomed by all. It's called 'reciprocation'!
More people die in road accidents, maybe we should put the drivers in there too?
There is no proof that all Muslims are terrorists.
Why do you think this? What do you think they are going to do to us?
All peoples have a place in every part of the world.
Which evidence do you have that Jews control the U.S. government? They are rather a small but active minority within it.
A lack of love towards children is a lot more likely to cause harm than lesbians. Children can be raised well by anyone if they are good parents, including lesbians.
It is not true that thieves are more likely to commit crimes if they are members of a specific racial or ethnic background.
Muslims criticize violence and terrorism as well. They even became victims of ISIS after they denounced ISIS for its violent actions.
I am tired of the deliberate lies or appalling lack of understanding about a religion followed by 23% of the world. Enough IS ENOUGH!
Gay men are not promiscuous. To suggest otherwise is to be grossly generalistic. How many gay men do you know?
lgbt+ people are human beings.
Christian Europeans are the ones that then expanded the slave trade to an industrial scale and instrumentalised exploitation as a key component of our economy.
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
Refugee crisis in our country is a burden to our society.
when they don't know what people and what are saying, them? what about being forced at you? it's like you like a good plan.

Small groups of people peacefully gather to pray, but because they do not look like you, you are outraged? Why am I not surprised?
so prejudice and xenophobia are incompatible with this.

No. A religion of 1.6 billion people is not the same as Nazism and it is ignorant to say so.
it is a religious ideology that promotes violence and violence.
All religions are compatible with the modern world, including Islam. What is incompatible with modernity is Islamophobia.
why are you saying this? islam is not evil. about? hate is not prejudice against violence, it like banning other people.
Actually, in 2015 13,286 people were killed in the US by firearms and 26,819 were injured. Tell me does that count as terrorism or it is only that when Muslims do it?
WIthout softeness and emotions there would just be brutality and cruelty. Not all women are soft and emotional and many men have these characteristics. To perpetuate these socially constructed gender profiles maintains patriarchal norms which oppress both men and women.
This is a very misleading concept used to describe people who are discriminated against, particularly Africans. They are all people who have been affected by racism. They deserve to be valued and respected, and we are so proud of having them in our country.
it doesn't matter what you're talking about. how can you say otherwise?
we need to blame them if they want to. would you need to be a bit too authoritarian?
Let's see what women have to say about this topic instead of using sexist stereotypes.
There is no evidence that Muslims are incompatible with Western society.
"Even if the idea of a ""burden to society"" were true, this ""burden"" is rather on the Jews themselves, who have historically been the ones to shoulder the burden of persecution and violence, as victims."

jews who have the same rights as anyone else.

Why do you say this about immigrants? They are just people like us.
Muslims contribute a lot to our society. What are you contributing other than intolerance?
Black people are not slaves. It's an inaccurate, misleading and offensive term that lumps all African American together. Why do you say that blacks are slaves and not people?

Muslims are part of the European Union, and have lived here ever since. Their presence is evidence enough that they have always been a part of 'civilised' Europe.

Since you seem to have a problem with Islam, I wonder what you think of the banning of the Quran in UK. It would be a law that prevents Muslims from openly discussing Islam in public places. We can do the same with the Bible and ban any trace of religions and cultures. Will we be left with some freedom then?
islam promotes violence against women and women. anyone can feel their sexual preferences.
The Koran does not condone sexual molester behavior, and if the Koran were to be read, it is clear that it was intended as a guide for its believers.
most jews live in the democratic society. after all, it is true that they are incapable from it.
What you are saying is that Muslims are not welcome in our country? Why shouldn't they be?
The image was photoshopped, original here. Muslims have never wanted to kill us or anyone, this image in fact demonstrates that there is no evidence for it so people have to make it up.
i don't think it has never stating statements that have have sexual orientations and the only are that. how can you say this about an entire religion?
It is not true that all the immigrants in the US are illegal. In fact, they are often in the US on humanitarian grounds.

I am not sure I fully understand the suggestion that Jews have no conscience. All Jews I know have both a conscience and a moral sense. How many Jews do you know personally?
Why should we restrict women's rights? We should respect their rights as well.
Associating AIDS and HIV with homosexuals is just a prejudice driven by fear. Even if this disease may be more common among gay people, that does not mean that all homosexuals are likely to have AIDS. Not all homosexuals are promiscuously fornicating with strangers, as you said. Most people check their partners, more so as gay men.
Muslims are part of the European Union, and have lived here ever since. Their presence is evidence enough that they have always been a part of 'civilised' Europe.

Why do you think this? What do you think they are going to do to us?
Feminism is a movement that says that there are certain 'man' prerogatives that are valid for women as well. How can you argue with that?
They do important jobs for us, such as family assistants, but often Italians do not do it anymore because these jobs are humble and tiring.
We don't need to deport every one of them, why do you say so?
islam is a peaceful religion, it is not a belief
Children with learning difficulties can contribute to society, thus they should be part of education.

Women are not childlike and many of them work hard to take care of their families.
Why should not Muslims be allowed to build Mosques here? I thought this country believed in giving people the freedom to practice religions other than Christianity?

have you ever spoken at a muslim?
Migrants are humans, and are entitled to the same rights as others, such as to ask for hospitality.
What about if you were isolated from the rest of us for your sexual orientation? Would it be right to be isolated from your loved ones and friends?

All the people from Pakistan that I know are really nice! No need to generalize too much!
I want them here?
Muslims contribute a lot to our society. What are you contributing other than intolerance?
share your argument really? and muslims are incompatible really?
Women are allowed to do whatever they choose to do, so don't you think it's fair for them to complain about upkeeping the house if it is not what they want to do? The chores should be shared with the other members of the family.
Except for Muslims, both Jesus and Easter are very important so they do not really have a problem with Easter.
A lot of migrants have worked hard for the improvement of our society. To say that they steal our jobs is absurd.
I'd think the root of all the world problems today is over-population and ecology. Why do you blame Islam in all the problems?
This is not true, they are good citizens too. They are not a burden to the UK, it is time to invest in them.
Have won at what? The only thing I see is paranoid messages like this painting a not so convincing picture of some sort of Muslim originated threat.
Are you sure that Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society? Do you have any statistics on that?
The country has always been made of people from different backgrounds coming together and creating a more just and peaceful society. Then it is in everyone's interest to promote mutual understanding and integration: it is the best solution to prevent conflicts within communities.
So what about Muslims born in the UK whose national flag is the Union Jack?
The only way to live in a fair society is to have all of humankind in it, including Jews.
This is not true. Rape and torture of women and children is forbidden by the Qur'an.
So how come the media doesn't report about Jewish power in the financial world? Maybe it's because they also control the media, the government, and have many powerful friends working for the Galactic Republic... #sarcasm
Most feminists are not violent, they share only the struggle for equality.
It is not true that all the immigrants in the US are illegal. In fact, they are often in the US on humanitarian grounds.

Tbh I am struggling to find any Chocolate Eggs which are not labelled as Easter Eggs.
Refugee crisis in our country is a burden to our society.
That is not the case, tuberculosis is a global health problem. Immigrants do not bring diseases, and if they do, the solution is to treat them.
If the goal of a religion was to celebrate death, then it is a religion that must be banned from any country. But the truth is that Islam is not a death clut, hence it should not be banned.
i don't think it has never stating statements that have have sexual orientations and the only are that. how can you say this about an entire religion?
Gay men are not promiscuous. To suggest otherwise is to be grossly generalistic. How many gay men do you know?
Should we 'put all Christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror attacks in the name of their faith? Or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority?

The world would be a better place if people were more tolerant to each other.
No one is stopping you from celebrating Easter, nor are they offended by it.
there are too different working programmes into non-muslim societies.
You can't blame people of color for being weak, this is racism. Black people are people as is anybody else.
in every country homosexuals have been persecuted for their physical rights and the lack of the fear of the sexes.
The point of listening to Muslim women, and women in general, is that they could broaden and enlighten your view of the world.
I think it is important to understand that there are different types of racism, some are based on historical or racial discrimination, while some are about individual differences. For me, the real issue is about racism in general. And your claim reminds me of that.
There are a lot of non-Muslim terrorists but the media focuses on Muslim terrorists and does not call the non-Muslim ones terrorists. When was the last time you saw a white non-muslim school shooter in the US branded a 'terrorist'?

How can you be sure they control the world? Maybe there are some influential Jews in the world, but how does that coincide with 'controlling the world'?
jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are good brothers and sisters.
If it is then it certainly hasn't been a religion of 'conquest' quite as successfully as some others. What about Christianity and colonialism?
Does that mean Jews as a 2,5% minority can control all levels of government? In a democratic country, we believe that every minority should be represented in the government and it guarantees that noone has total control over anything.
You are wrong about that. Blacks are genetically similar to us, and this does not make them inferior.
Should we 'put all Christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror attacks in the name of their faith? Or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority?

The real disgrace is that children are being force fed intolerance of others and hate from tweets like this!
there are too different working programmes into non-muslim societies.
Not all rapists are black and not all black are rapists. Skin color doesn't make you a criminal.
The media focuses on a small proportion of rape cases involving Muslim gangs, whilst a huge number of non-Muslim cases get no news coverage, and many are not reported at all.
do you know these muslims are just in the us too. so, do you think muslims are religious or terrorists.
If Islam were a totalitarian ideology, we would have had Islamic totalitarian states in Europe since time immemorial. Islam is a religion, that is compatible with Europe's principles.
"The idea that Jews are ""control freaks"" is untrue. They are just like any other people."

the ones who deserved to be punished, were punished. if they were innocent, do that we should not be persecuted in their religion.
refugees fleeing wars and poverty are not a choice.
There is no such thing as 'male supremacy'. Therefore we must promote equal rights and protect women from discrimination.
I do not see why that would be offensive.? Please do walk your dog, it needs the exercise.

they are welcome here, as well as anyone else.

This is not true, homosexuality is a sexual preference, not a mental disorder.

Or maybe children who have Down syndrome are at higher risk of physical abuse and bulling.
I would have thought that the problem would be with the fact that you don't want to assimilate with them. Today we are blessed to be able to live in a multicultural society, and the real problem is that we don't want to accept that diversity.

No, Muslims are actually more likely to be the victim of a terrorist attack, especially those living in the Middle-East.
Have won at what? The only thing I see is paranoid messages like this painting a not so convincing picture of some sort of Muslim originated threat.
Feminism is about women's rights, which are about equality.
We can blame all black people of crime, or we can talk about the absence of black people in positions of power, the wealth gap ecc. But this never happens.
migrants contribute to our economy by persecution to create new jobs. they are part of our society. we have to leave our country, as they wish.
How can you be sure they control the world? Maybe there are some influential Jews in the world, but how does that coincide with 'controlling the world'?
the ones who deserved to be punished, were punished. if they were innocent, do that we should not be persecuted in their religion.
Rapism is banned in the Muslim community equally to our community! It is not true to say that Muslims do not care about such matters. They discuss it widely in their families, though not publicly.
This was a prank planned by non-muslims on 4chan. Muslim do not mind if you take your dogs out for a walk. This blog post shows the thread it came from;
Women are not childlike and many of them work hard to take care of their families.
Women are born equal in the eyes of the Creator. In Allah’s creation, no priority or superiority is accorded to either man or woman.
I do not understand how can you say something so offensive to women. Think about your friends and relatives: all women are affected by this kind of misogyny.
Muslims are part of our society and have contributed to our culture and economy. They are our brothers and sisters.
All religions are compatible with the modern world, including Islam. What is incompatible with modernity is Islamophobia.
refugees fleeing wars and poverty are not a choice.
Crime is not the fault of migrants, but of violent people.
Maybe you should think about this...not all women are childlike, and some women are childlike with kiddos only!
Why would we nuke the third world? There's nothing to worry about them, they are not causing any trouble. They have the right to life as anyone else in the world.
Being gay is not a problem, being homophobic is.
Are you really sure about that? How could you be?
Muslims cannot celebrate their own holidays without fear of being targeted by Islamophobic hatred.
It is not true that all migrants are criminals, they are hard-working people.
NHS is for everyone, with services free of charge. It would be against everything the NHS stands for to start checking people's background and turn them down based on that.
You cannot compare a faith of 1.6 billion to Nazi.
Violence has no place in a religion, and in no way should be justified. Islam is a religion of peace.
That is not how it works: if you think there is a problem, then you need to work with the problem, not against it, otherwise things will just keep on getting worse. And, just for the record, I do not believe that POC are a social problem.
muslims have been a part of european society for hundreds of years, they are helped to build the world of new fields.
I'm sorry to hear you don't feel safe in your local area anymore but what does migrants moving to the area have to do with that?
Migrants come here to work and pay taxes. They don't deserve to be called 'a burden'.
Yeah. But no. Computer says 16% of Muslim women and 11% of Muslim men are unemployed and claiming benefits. If others aren't working then they're not on benefits just being taken care of by hard working family members. As I hope my children will do for me one day (are you listening son?).
All races are biologically related, so we are all naturally violent. The issue is how we treat each other as people, that's all.
If the stolen job is an illegal one, then it is difficult to steal.
Gays are not disgusting pricks. They are just like any other person.
Do you know what exactly Sharia law is?
Nonsense. Western societies are successful because they are inclusive.
Jews were not obsessed with the holocaust. The murder of some 6 millions Jews by the Nazis shocked the world. Most of the survivors were only killed because they were suspected of belonging to a particular community. The Jewish people suffered greatly as a result of persecution, and the holocaust should be remembered not to let this happen again.
Many migrants come to this country to work, provide for their families and access the benefits system only if necessary. They are more than welcome here as long as they integrate.
Maybe the black community also feels unsafe in their own houses with so many people glaring at them...
What about recent school and mall shootings all over the US? Those were White Christian terrorists.
people have the right to exist here.
There is no evidence that Muslims are incompatible with Western society.
isn't all human defenders to the nhs majority of freedom fighters? muslims feel everywhere!
muslims contribute a lot to our society. through refer to work and provided through their contributions.
we cannot let over muslims in the uk, this is only a justification. you are worried like this?
Violence is never justified in Islam. There is no such thing as 'the religion of violence'. The Quran does not teach it.
this is false. only fact, the vast majority of terrorist crimes are committed by right-wing extremists, not violent muslims.
Well at least they're not taking our jobs then!
The far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.
Muslim people are inherently human, like every other person on the planet. Why would you say that?
"This is just not true. Women don't have to conform to dominant ideas on what they are supposed to be like, and this is a good thing. There is no such thing as ""what a woman should be""."
Feminists understand that men and women are different, but to ask for equal rights is not about denying this.
The world would be a better place if people were more tolerant to each other.
Have won at what? The only thing I see is paranoid messages like this painting a not so convincing picture of some sort of Muslim originated threat.
are you referring to you control the same out on a power community? i do not think so.
Why would it? The Koran is a peaceful religious book.
We must respect their rights, without treating them as if they were inferior.
Far right extremism is just a nasty stain on humanity.
Here's lots of proof the holocaust happened: survivors, concentration camps, documents, millions of deaths. How can you say it never happened when there is so much evidence to prove that it did?
The ones who deserved to be punished, were punished. If others are innocent, clearly they do not deserve to be penalized?
Drugs are only harmful to people using them and if you are a violent person you should be put in prison. Why should a group of people be put in prison for their private choices or skin color?
More people die in road accidents, maybe we should put the drivers in there too?
All religions are compatible with the modern world, including Islam. What is incompatible with modernity is Islamophobia.
Being religious has never stopped anyone from being in public office before. Christians have allegiance to God, is that not the same thing?
If you judge a woman based on how many people she’s slept with, but you wouldn’t judge a man for the same thing, that’s a double standard!
Gay people are not a danger to children, unless they are being abused. Please do not make such a statement.
Many pupils with learning difficulties attend school. This does not prove that others would prefer to attend school if people with difficulties were excluded from the education system.
The Koran does not condone sexual molester behavior, and if the Koran were to be read, it is clear that it was intended as a guide for its believers.
you're a religion of an entire community. faith is not a violent religion.
This is not true. Rape and torture of women and children is forbidden by the Qur'an.
don't you sure that black people are inherently incompatible with western society? they are part of our society without any muslims.
Limiting donors to such an extent (i.e. by excluding all gay people) would limit the amount of available blood and potentially lead to shortages.
Countries, not religions, have laws. And the followers of a religion, Muslims in our case, have obligations under those laws as citizens. That's all.
The far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.
Muslims contribute a lot to our society. What are you contributing other than intolerance?
the refugees come here to work and have proven to be discriminated against by jews. but is that it much better now?
Many survivors confessed that they were willing to provide their children with stories of the Holocaust but it was very difficult emotionally. They want to talk about the aspects of life for Jews during the time of the Holocaust to not forget what happened.
there are too different working programmes into non-muslim societies.
the koran has not command this.
Islam is a religion, and it has been proven time and time again that its teachings do not threaten the very existence of Western civilization.
That is not the case, tuberculosis is a global health problem. Immigrants do not bring diseases, and if they do, the solution is to treat them.
Every Muslim is a potential peace advocate as well.
Women are just as capable of feeling emotions as men, and men can likewise be just as empathic.
Some people choose to live here based on the fact that they have never lived in a safe country. You would do the same, wouldn't you?
Gays are not disgusting pricks. They are just like any other person.
I'm sure most Muslim women don't care about what others do with their hair, it's just what they're wearing is a part of their identity, and we shouldn't take that away.
yes, when? it seems like a way to catch this know that islam is no such hatred sounds like a lot of our religion?
Many faiths are changing to end inequality and persecution of women and gay people and each have people who resist that change. Islam is no better or worse.
To be fair, the OFSTED report is more concerned with lack of enforcement and less about focussing on the practice of any particular faith.
Tbh I am struggling to find any Chocolate Eggs which are not labelled as Easter Eggs.
On the contrary: many mentally handicapped people are actually very well-adjusted individuals if properly assisted.
If a migrant crosses our borders, that does not mean that he or she wants to settle down or find work here.
are you aware of the quran then.
feminism is about equality. but about having feminist equality is about equality.
Yes, we do.
Have you really read Quran? Actually Quran is not about hate speech. It teaches people to respect people and do good things.
jews are part of our culture, and they have every right to be citizens and welcome that.
Yeah. But no. Computer says 16% of Muslim women and 11% of Muslim men are unemployed and claiming benefits. If others aren't working then they're not on benefits just being taken care of by hard working family members. As I hope my children will do for me one day (are you listening son?).
African people are able to feel pain like any other person. We should respect their bodies like ours.
That sounds fake, where did you see this? I’m sure they really don’t care.
what happened, my friend? do you have to look at what what makes you even with,
You are wrong about that. Blacks are genetically similar to us, and this does not make them inferior.
it is a religious ideology that promotes violence and violence.
or this person is not a terrorist.
Another rapist from England. We should ...
Islam is a religion, not a cancer.
islam promotes violence against women and women. anyone can feel their sexual preferences.
The assumption that the actions of a few typify the behavior of all is at the heart of prejudice and discrimination. Every ethnic or religious group, can count greedy or cheap people among its members, not only the jews.
How can you be sure they control the world? Maybe there are some influential Jews in the world, but how does that coincide with 'controlling the world'?
this is not true. our idea is a movement that is about equal rights, by others, to the goal of feminism is also about equal rights and rights for everyone.
Some migrants create jobs for Italians.
i have the idea that feminism is to the u. s. states already still used by inclusive, but in the world there is different living in the eyes of the world. we actually wish to give them that. but we just have the same choice as well. as a whole.
Many Muslims live in the UK. They are our neighbours and we should welcome them.
Maybe appeasement to people of different faith and beliefs is not such a bad thing. They call it tolerance.
Gay men contribute to our society like anyone else and as such are entitled to human rights.
Women must be allowed to have space in a democratic society. Don't you think so?
We should be encouraging integration, not rejecting migrants who have been coming to our country for many years.
When they refused to serve you just what was it you were saying or doing in the minutes before? Why do I feel there is a fuller story here?
Fat people are not the ones responsible for your suffering and lack of access to basic healthcare services.
Another rapist from England. We should ...
if you burn people in this country will be preoccupied by their faith.
Migrants are welcome in the EU, they are just human beings in need. We must respect our differences and accept them.
Maybe it is not they do not want to assimilate but they do not know our society and how to assimilate. If we can help them fit into the society, you would see that they respect our laws and cultures.
WIthout softeness and emotions there would just be brutality and cruelty. Not all women are soft and emotional and many men have these characteristics. To perpetuate these socially constructed gender profiles maintains patriarchal norms which oppress both men and women.
Islam is about acceptance, not a death cult. In your opinion, what makes it criminal?
There is no evidence that Muslims are incompatible with Western society.
Jews have always been part of our society and are our brothers and sisters, they don't want to see our culture be destroyed. We are a diverse society and that is why we have a lot in common with them.
There is no such thing as a set of rights for black and one for white.
Jews try to influence the world in a positive way just as everyone else is doing. I don't see any evidence to suggest that they are the most powerful people in the world.
Accepting people from all walks of life is not an illness.
Migrants do not receive 35 euros per se, this money is paid to the co-ops to cover food and accommodation during the period spent in first aid facilities
Many Gypsies have regular jobs, but we do not know, because they don't need to tell.
To use an old saying, you cannot be 'European' and be a 'racist'.
Just for the records: Jews interpret the “chosen people” idea as an ethical responsibility, not as a moral superiority.
Islam is a peaceful religion
Migrants have given their lives for our country, they are our fellow citizens, and they deserve to be respected as such.
Islam is about acceptance, not a death cult. In your opinion, what makes it criminal?
it is a religious ideology that promotes violence and violence.
Muslims are peaceful. The Koran doesn't talk about killing infidels, why would it do that?
Migrants are not a burden to our country. Migrants have been proven to be contributing members of society.
This is demonstrably false. Muslims make up around 12% of unemployed people in the UK - the vast majority work hard and contribute to the UK economy.
Some migrants create jobs for Italians.
The movie industry has developed thanks to Jews, that's true, but seeing the Academy Awards makes it clear that Jews do not dominate the industry. In fact, only a few of Fortune 500 companies are run by Jews.
Migrants are completely able to integrate in our society. They are an integral part of our society and proud of their heritage. How can we be inclusive if we exclude them?
I'd suggest a walk down West London where areas like St John's Wood are very affluent with mostly white people living there.
A woman has every right to her own body, and she should be allowed to make her own decisions.
A much bigger threat to our diverse, tolerant western civilisation is hatred generalised to entire religions.
We are not accepting this. These people are being rightly punished for their actions. But my question is, what is the point of bringing up the religion? Do you really think this is the cause of the problem?
The Quran does not mention FGM and it is carried out by Christians as well as Muslims. The fact that her parents are Muslim has no bearing on the risk factor.
You are wrong about that. Blacks are genetically similar to us, and this does not make them inferior.
This is a lie spread by anti-semites and it's been proved many times over that the Jews have no monopoly of the world.
No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!
islam promotes violence, and consent, not an ideology and conquest.
This is just fear mongering, the problem is not about Islam. The problem is radical Islam and the absence of a strong Islamic identity in our country. We should work together to make the UK more tolerant and Islam less taboo.
Maybe you should think about this...not all women are childlike, and some women are childlike with kiddos only!
not all muslims are guilty in extremism. not a lack of violence towards other people.
Homosexuals are not sick, but they might have a mental health crisis because of prejudice. Being isolated from society can only worsen the situation.
Double standards all round lots of British culture and Christian faiths oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures from #equalpay #metoo #timesup job restrictions in the church to condoning/ hiding sexual violence and child exploitation #thetruthproject.
they have a look to our society. most sick people are just like us there.
I don't think lgbt+ humans are incompatible with all mankind... they're human too.
The real disgrace is that children are being force fed intolerance of others and hate from tweets like this!
Violence against women is a social issue and needs a political solution.
Not all rapists are black and not all black are rapists. Skin color doesn't make you a criminal.

Gays are not disgusting pricks. They are just like any other person.

Yeah London is very diverse, why do you feel like this is a bad thing?
Muslims are part of the European Union, and have lived here ever since. Their presence is evidence enough that they have always been a part of 'civilised' Europe.
muslims contribute a lot to our society. through refer to work and provided through their contributions.

"The idea that Jews are ""control freaks"" is untrue. They are just like any other people."
Let's have a crusade. Except did not the last one lead to child rape, enslavement and murder?
I don't think the world would be a better place without immigrants. From what I understand, they often bring positive changes to the world.
Immigration can be good for the economy: the greatest challenge is to integrate those who are misfortunate and aren't born here.
the bible from quran does not command questions.
Christmas still seems to be going ahead in this country, who exactly are these Muslims that are offended by it? Sounds like fake news to me.
I think you will find race hate started by the English when we first set foot overseas, Crusade anyone?
Jews don't control Hollywood, it simply is a place of great freedom where many people work, including Jews.

Homosexuality is only a personal preference on relationships, why would they be banned because of that?
This is demonstrably false. Muslims make up around 12% of unemployed people in the UK - the vast majority work hard and contribute to the UK economy.
Jews have been part of our country since its creation and have always had a place here. Why would they be 'not welcome'?
This is not true. Rape and torture of women and children is forbidden by the Qur'an.
it is a religious ideology that promotes violence and violence.

"It is not true that this ""lifestyle choice"" means being gay. And rape is a crime issue, not a lifestyle one."
Islam is really about peace unification and peace to the world, not about bloodshed and troubles.

They also pay taxes, contributing to the cost of these services, and are less likely than native Brits to claim benefits, as many are not entitled to it!

How about we work together to find a solution to violent nationalism and racism instead? We can't accept this hate being present in different countries over and over again.
refugees fleeing wars and poverty are not a choice.
Gays are not disgusting pricks. They are just like any other person.

Being forced to eat my peas when I was a kid just made me hate them even more. Still cannot stomach the damn things.
Feminism fights for equality of rights, and women are entitled to that. Everyone should have the same human rights.
Muslims create over 70000 jobs in their firms in London alone, so no they do not refuse to work, they in fact create work for others.
some horrible people are responsible for their culture. it is a false religion. that has been controlled by many countries and such a greater good of the community.

Gay people are not disgusting and especially they are not rapists. That is a dangerous stereotype that doesn't reflect reality.
A definition of Judaism based on physical or genetic traits is misleading because Jews appear throughout the world. Jews resemble their non-Jewish neighbors in the countries from which they originate.
jews contribute greatly to our society, and they are our brothers and sisters.
Feminism is about the equality of the sexes, and many women use feminism as a mean to achieve their legitimate goals. Through equality they can get to the opportunities that otherwise won't be accessible to them.

You are wrong about that. Blacks are genetically similar to us, and this does not make them inferior.

Migrants have given their lives for our country, they are our fellow citizens, and they deserve to be respected as such.

If migrants do not want to work, then why there are many doing jobs we don't want to do?
Bisexual men are men?
If you dislike diversity so much, why do not you go off and live in a country where there are no Muslims, only people like you?
Being gay is not a problem, being homophobic is.
Had lunch with some Muslim friends recently. Somehow, I am still HIV and Ebola free!
Improvements in testing and other safeguards have reduced the risk from transfusion transmitted HIV, so ruling out donors only because of their sexual orientation is completely meaningless.
You should check some scientific papers then, because all humans, including blacks, have brains.
Gays are not disgusting pricks. They are just like any other person.
This is not true. Rape and torture of women and children is forbidden by the Qur'an.
Maybe you should consider that not all women are childlike, and that some women are 'childlike' with children!
immigrants are a contributing part in our country. they are our brothers and sisters.
muslims contribute a lot to our society. through refer to work and provided through their contributions.
i think it is myth that we are invaded from many over the world. they have been part of our history and history.
Migrants often integrate very well into the local culture. So, they do contribute to society.
The West has always been about freedom, democracy and the rule of law. Freedom and democracy are things that can be achieved only by a multiethnic, pluralistic, civilised society.
they shouldn't be human to have the same rights as anyone else.
The shockingly low number of rape convictions in the UK shows not enough counteraction from the police and gov in rape cases generally, of which the vast majority are not committed by Muslims.
Only 3% are nomads (sinti), others are sedentary.
It's not true that all black people are aggressive. Also, the majority of our population is white, we don't need that much protection.
religions cannot use violence and violence against violence.
No one is forcing kids to transition, if a child feels like they are transgender then actually being able to medically transition with hormones is not a decision ever taken lightly, and it's a long and stressful process involving consultation from many medical and psychological professionals.
NHS is for everyone, with services free of charge. It would be against everything the NHS stands for to start checking people's background and turn them down based on that.
That is misleading! The Atlantic slave trade was mostly linked to Christians, but no one calls it Christian slave trade.
Since the beginning of time, we have welcomed people fleeing war and persecution. Why do you think it is a problem now?
Women make up over 45% of the labour force in the UK. They should be allowed to have their say. What happened to the rule of law?
Homosexuals are not sick, but they might have a mental health crisis because of prejudice. Being isolated from society can only worsen the situation.
isn't this nothing like you? what can you say that police this is?
it is a religious ideology that promotes violence and violence.
Every Muslim is a potential peace advocate as well.
it's not true that all migrants are terrorists! they deserve allowed to take their lives, and they live in a country to live their life here.
Like all human people, some women are better than others at certain things, and this does not need fixing by men.
Rape has no religion. These are highly emotional issues, and are difficult to talk about openly, especially when children are involved. This is why news programs are reluctant to give coverage to it.
why is it the link between men? and this can have a problem in the modern world.
There is no proof that all Muslims are terrorists.
You don't have to hate gays only because you don't like them. Did they do something to you? I think you have all your rights.
isn't this nothing like you? what can you say that police this is?
"What do you mean ""nothing"" to our society? Muslims have contributed a lot to our society, including art, science, literature, our infrastructure and healthcare system."
Feminism is a movement that says that there are certain 'man' prerogatives that are valid for women as well. How can you argue with that?
so much hatred. we should understand and we must wish accept diversity.
Our values of freedom of expression, equality and human rights are being eroded by islamophobes who are dedicated to replacing our values of accdeptance with a fundamentalist, intolerant attitude.
Associating AIDS and HIV with homosexuals is just a prejudice driven by fear. Even if this disease may be more common among gay people, that does not mean that all homosexuals are likely to have AIDS. Not all homosexuals are promiscuously fornicating with strangers, as you said. Most people check their partners, more so as gay men.
muslims contribute a lot to our society. through refer to work and provided through their contributions.
i think we cannot believe that islam and not about violence.
muslims contribute a lot to our society. through refer to work and provided through their contributions.
"Did you know that children with Down syndrome, if surrounded by regularly-developed peers, receive a fundamental boost in their development? This ""mix"" fosters a positive learning atmosphere and increases engagement and attention in all students. This mean that children with Down syndrome would be a burden to society if isolated, not the contrary."
There are Bible scriptures about the stoning to death of virgins who do not scream when they are raped, we do not blame the bible for Christian rapists. The Quran.
Tbh I am struggling to find any Chocolate Eggs which are not labelled as Easter Eggs.
Children are being taught Islam as much as they're being taught about all the other religions. I hardly think this counts as indoctrination.
That sounds homophobic to me.
Gays are not a disease. Homosexuality is a sexual orientation.
A lot of immigrants feel insecure and unsafe in their own country, if we want to make our country better, we need to make sure everyone, immigrant or not, feels safe and protected.
Well, in that case, we are all subhuman, regardless of gender.
Yes, a 'moon cult' that has been around for thousands of years, has holy books, formed the basis for many early and modern societies. Sounds a lot like any other real religion to me?
Women are neither childlike nor soft and emotional. They feel emotions as part of who they are and their human nature.
Islam - Silence is tacit acceptance. Raise your voice against Islamophobia!
To be fair, the OFSTED report is more concerned with lack of enforcement and less about focussing on the practice of any particular faith.
Nonsense. Western societies are successful because they are inclusive.
Of course there are whites that have been victims of police brutality, but the most important statistic I have seen is that of blacks being 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police in the US.
This is not true. The idea might come from being born into a white-majority country, but it is inherently dangerous. In fact, we are born in a country where a person's rights are protected regardless of the tone of the skin.
Women are human beings, and they are valued equally, that's why we have to listen to them.
are you really suggesting that that are entering the u. s. government? they are committed by foreigners.
Women should have equal rights in a free society, without discrimination.
Having a mosque built down the road is causing you problems? Really?
I don't understand why women are always told what they have to do. Women are humans with rights that need to be respected.
Islam like any other religion, is not incompatible with a modern state.
Let's face it, a country with a higher ratio of homosexuality would be of greater help in the fight against AIDS.
Crime is not the fault of migrants, but of violent people.
The Bible has many different teachings on homosexuality and faith. The Bible does not speak about the democratic society, in which we are living in mutual acceptance.
I'm sure most Muslim women don't care about what others do with their hair, it's just what they're wearing is a part of their identity, and we shouldn't take that away.
To be fair, the OFSTED report is more concerned with lack of enforcement and less about focussing on the practice of any particular faith.
Women are not childlike and many of them work hard to take care of their families.
rapists and the victims of non-muslim abuse.
This was a prank planned by non-muslims on 4chan. Muslim do not mind if you take your dogs out for a walk. This blog post shows the thread it came from;
why are you saying this? islam is not evil. about? hate is not prejudice against violence, it like banning other people.
There are lots of different races, and someone can't be judged as inferior just by skin color.
Who has? Nobody has been at war with an entire faith for a thousand years.
The N-word is an insult that is still used to demean African Americans. It has nothing to do with political correctness.
do you know these muslims are just in the us too. so, do you think muslims are religious or terrorists.
All religions are compatible with the modern world, including Islam. What is incompatible with modernity is Islamophobia.
why are you saying this? islam is not evil. about? hate is not prejudice against violence, it like banning other people.
This statement just makes no sense
During the depression following the second world war, Muslims from across the world were invited to Britain to help combat austerity. It worked. They were invited because countries across the world had already been subjugated by the British Empire.
no one is considered a burden to them.
muslims are welcome here. these are welcome. they are our brothers and sisters.
I do not see why that would be offensive.? Please do walk your dog, it needs the exercise.
this is no threat that muslims are terrorists.
feminism is about equality. feminists is an movement gender empowerment of men and women.
Have won at what? The only thing I see is paranoid messages like this painting a not so convincing picture of some sort of Muslim originated threat.
actually, all women men want to be even with the one don’t do with many men and people want. they want to be happy.
Equality means that a man would not be called a coward. Women have plenty to offer the world of politics and as much of a right to take part as anyone else.
All religions are compatible with the modern world, including Islam. What is incompatible with modernity is Islamophobia.
Small groups of people peacefully gather to pray, but because they do not look like you, you are outraged? Why am I not surprised?
There is no evidence that Muslims are incompatible with Western society.
Men are still the primary aggressors in most sexual assaults, and women are victims in about as many cases. This is about sexism, don't you think?
in reality, millions of immigrants come to the economic crisis.
Muslim people are inherently human, like every other person on the planet. Why would you say that?
If it is then it certainly hasn't been a religion of 'conquest' quite as successfully as some others. What about Christianity and colonialism?
Don't those scriptures also say, ' Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.'.
we constitute a british threat to our communities, not all from muslims. muslims are significantly to the victims is often from a muslim. (insert news evidence like your scapegoat is wrong.
Homosexuality is only a personal preference on relationships, why would they be banned because of that?
So you think that they are not 'legitimate' for having less rights than us? That they do not have a 'legitimate demand' since they are not granted citizenship?
Jews are not controlling. Maybe you should try to understand that Jews are a group of regular people, and they are not all members of a secret intelligence.
This myth traces back to “The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion”, that is used as proof of a Jewish conspiracy to rule the world. But the Protocols are a proven forgery, written by agents of the Russian czar in the late 19th century, that spread throughout the 20th century and continues to this day.
Being Jewish doesn't make you any less of a human being. The fact that you are Jewish doesn't mean that you deserve less human rights.
muslims have contributed much to our country.
Double standards all round lots of British culture and Christian faiths oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures from #equalpay #metoo #timesup job restrictions in the church to condoning/ hiding sexual violence and child exploitation #thetruthproject.
feminism is a movement that is violence. in fact, many feminists also engage for women's rights, and the laws of importance of the value to <unk> that we must respect and personal rights.
Easter Eggs were always about children getting chocolate and very little about any religion.
we need to deport all people fleeing their countries because they are coming because of their countries.
All women are human beings. The problem arises when women are taught that they are subhuman.
i think we cannot believe that islam and not about violence.
Why do you think this? What do you think they are going to do to us?
Rape, torture and murder are abominations to all religions.
don't you sure that black people are inherently incompatible with western society? they are part of our society without any muslims.
If I say it and find one or two online references does that make it true? What if I write: 'The vast majority of Islamophobes are unemployed and refuse to work.' ?
Accepting people from all walks of life is not an illness.
bloody retribution? your eye for the eye makes the whole world blind!
There is a difference between being bisexual and wanting to transition genders, the two things aren't related.
are you sure? that an awful picture of #visitmymosque statement?
I am tired of seeing women being treated as sex objects. It's about time that women are given the respect they deserve.
If values of tolerance, respect and human decency are akin to mental illness, I am happy to be classed that way.
Is that why you feel that way about homosexuals? They are not sick, are they? And if you are gay you are not a pervert by default.
Gay people exist, and are loved and valued for who they are. They are human beings with full human rights.
A British dog born in a British stable is not a horse, but its still British. We have obligations both 'to' and 'for' our Citizen's, be they good or evil surely?
I think any book written that long ago probably would.
Do you really think that people from other cultures are flooding into our country, with the aim of mixing and finally replacing us? If so, I would be very surprised.
Islam is a religion of peace. It is a religion of tolerance. To promote violence and hatred is not the faith of peace.
islam promotes violence against women and women. anyone can feel their sexual preferences.
Children are being taught Islam as much as they're being taught about all the other religions. I hardly think this counts as indoctrination.
so prejudice and xenophobia are incompatible with this.
This is a myth perpetuated by anti-feminists to justify their violent behavior against women. Feminism is actually for equality between sexes.
These incidents must be reported to the police, of course, but we should focus on the rape, not who's doing it.
islam is a religion of peace. it is a religion and peace.
Feminism is a progressive ideology. As such, it is in the process of changing sexist ideas.
How do you know that this is not an example of a woman talking about her own problems with another woman?
so the headscarf impedes brain function? seems like your point of its islam is its one to our right, and it does not be fearmongering to prevent the muslims groups homeless instead and not, in its rights.
Another rapist from England. We should ...
Maybe appeasement to people of different faith and beliefs is not such a bad thing. They call it tolerance.
Tbh I am struggling to find any Chocolate Eggs which are not labelled as Easter Eggs.
are you sure? that an awful picture of #visitmymosque statement?
Jews are not in charge of the media or the government. At least not in the United States of America.
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
Is it facts or just your imagination? I do not agree that they aim to take control of us. Maybe they are trying to build their society inside our country, but you are hypothesizing too much,.
Yeah. But no. Computer says 16% of Muslim women and 11% of Muslim men are unemployed and claiming benefits. If others aren't working then they're not on benefits just being taken care of by hard working family members. As I hope my children will do for me one day (are you listening son?).
There are plenty of stabbings, yes, but they're not all by migrants, where is the evidence to suggest so?
Muslims are part of the European Union, and have lived here ever since. Their presence is evidence enough that they have always been a part of 'civilised' Europe.
do you mean all british muslims who follow those british muslims?
The fact that the majority of men are interested in women does not mean that all men are interested in women. There are people interested in men as well.
The media are full of the rumours of rape and abuse committed by Muslim. The problem is not about Islam. It is about violence.
Women should be protected and respected for who they are, regardless of their position in a man's life. Respect should be given to everyone equally, since women are human beings just as men are.
Actually, a lot of asylum seekers really want to work, but it's illegal for them to do so whilst their claim is being processed. They are only allowed to live on asylum support in this time.
I don't think black people are inherently worse or better than us, they just have a different skin color. They're the same as us in all other respects.
There is no evidence that Muslims are incompatible with Western society.
I have a Jewish best friends who dedicates herself to help women and disadvantaged children, her whole family helps to make the UK a better place.
LGBTI people are able to live their life in many countries. What's the burden for others?
Western Society seems pretty incompatible with Western Society or any other at the moment, maybe we could learn something from Indonesia, which has been conflict free since 2005.
they are welcome to a better life, why should we stop them?
Just because they came to our country does not mean that they want to replace us. On the contrary, many of them are here to contribute to our country.
Women should be allowed to vote and to have equal rights, as it is stated in the Constitution.
It's not 'biology'. You're confusing sex and gender. Gender has nothing to do with our biology or body, it's about our identity and how we feel. Sex is our anatomy, hormones etc, but even this isn't as binary as many people beleive.
There is no evidence that women are less intelligent than men. Do you have any?
Jews are not controlling. Maybe you should try to understand that Jews are a group of regular people, and they are not all members of a secret intelligence.
Actually all modern science and mathematics are children of Islam.
Muslims make up a very important part of our country and its people. They are our neighbours, our friends. They are our brothers and sisters. They are our future. They are our future Britain.
Yes, a 'moon cult' that has been around for thousands of years, has holy books, formed the basis for many early and modern societies. Sounds a lot like any other real religion to me?
The far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.
Where did you get this information from? I do not believe any crime would be free from judge. We should have more failth in English laws and people who execute the laws.
Feminism is a call for equality, and it has served the world well in the past, but it has still much to fight for. Now is not the time to undermine its progress.
The image was photoshopped, original here. Muslims have never wanted to kill us or anyone, this image in fact demonstrates that there is no evidence for it so people have to make it up.
Gays are not a disease. Homosexuality is a sexual orientation.
This was a prank planned by non-muslims on 4chan. Muslim do not mind if you take your dogs out for a walk. This blog post shows the thread it came from;
what do they base your view on?
There are many undocumented immigrants that are so because they have overstayed their visas. That means that they entered the U.S. with lawful documentation and only later became illegal.
why do you think this is not true. most of holocaust have been responsibility for the well-being of the rest of the world.
Gay marriage is not a way to bring back slavery. LGBT+ people exist, and they should be respected.
Child rapes are not only convicted by muslims. In fact, around 90% of the sexual abuse are convicted by person known to the child. This is a sad truth. We should help children be free from sexual abuse and rape.
Not all women are childlike. You have no right to make such a sweeping statement about them.
in fact, we are part of our society and should should be banned.
The reasons of the 9/11 attacks were many and varied. Jews were not one of them.
Child molesters are people who have sexually abused children, and they can be Muslim or non-Muslim.
The Quran does not mention FGM and it is carried out by Christians as well as Muslims. The fact that her parents are Muslim has no bearing on the risk factor.
Another rapist from England. We should ...
We still can teach British, European and World history, but part of that is looking at the history of groups which have been erased from our history previously. Looking at the some of the historic struggles of LGBT people in the UK can inform the future for everyone!
Does that mean Jews as a 2,5% minority can control all levels of government? In a democratic country, we believe that every minority should be represented in the government and it guarantees that noone has total control over anything.
Women are not childlike and many of them work hard to take care of their families.
at most, most communities have also contributed to our society, and they can be able to integrate.
why are you saying this? islam is not evil. about? hate is not prejudice against violence, it like banning other people.
Who has? Nobody has been at war with an entire faith for a thousand years.
islam is a religion, that is not a war.
If values of tolerance, respect and human decency are akin to mental illness, I am happy to be classed that way.
It's not 'biology'. You're confusing sex and gender. Gender has nothing to do with our biology or body, it's about our identity and how we feel. Sex is our anatomy, hormones etc, but even this isn't as binary as many people beleive.
Perhaps we should have a look at what women have to say about this topic rather than perpetuating sexist stereotypes.
Do you have any proof that the Jews control the U.S. government? It seems highly unlikely to me.
AIDS is transmitted by unprotected sexual activity and anyone could engage in that. This is not a homosexual problem but rather a problem of stigamitazion.
"What do you mean ""nothing"" to our society? Muslims have contributed a lot to our society, including art, science, literature, our infrastructure and healthcare system."
religions cannot use violence and violence against violence.
islam is a religion that promotes tolerance and compassion.
It is true that some terrorists are Muslims, but there is no evidence of such a thing in the whole Muslim community.
If you read Qu'ran, you would know that there is nothing about hate in it. Statements of hate nad genocide do not come from this religion, but from specific people who are armed military groups. Do not confuse criminals and common people!
Muslims are part of the European Union, and have lived here ever since. Their presence is evidence enough that they have always been a part of 'civilised' Europe.
Women should be allowed to vote and to have equal rights, as it is stated in the Constitution.
Migrants are happy to contribute to the host country's economic growth, in order to give back to it in many ways.
jews are not taking our jobs. they are our brothers and sisters. we should respect them.
Feminism is not about the dominance of women. It is about equality.
islam is a religion of peace. or not all a freedom of love for such other religion and there is valid for loving individuals, and women for others.
of course where are you talking about this? there is no better bad <unk> society, so much diversity and culture.
If values of tolerance, respect and human decency are akin to mental illness, I am happy to be classed that way.
Fat people are not the ones responsible for your suffering and lack of access to basic healthcare services.
What, you mean the people who spend their lives reading, learning and practicing Islam do not know what its really about?
Don't trust police, social workers or anyone who can tell you the truth and show just how prejudiced and misleading this tweet is.
How about we start by respecting the person's right to live their life, and give them full equal rights?
Rape, torture and murder are abominations to all religions.
the people of color are mainly members of our culture, and they deserve their rights as well.
The 9/11 attacks were perpetrated by members of the terrorist organization Al Qaeda. Jews and Israelis have nothing to do with the attacks. These are the historical facts.
The assumption that the actions of a few typify the behavior of all is at the heart of prejudice and discrimination. Every ethnic or religious group, can count greedy or cheap people among its members, not only the jews.
What are some of the things that are racist about it?
what christianity and belief in nothing to do with western culture.
Afro-Saxon, as you call them, are great in many ways. They are proud and independent, refusing every categorization and stereotype. The fact that there are so many of them in the country proves that the feeling of belonging they have for our homeland is paramount to all other considerations.
muslims criticize violence and violence comes like muslims.
They don't, but I wonder why only the crimes with 'White British Non-Muslim' victims are the ones widely circulated?
muslims are welcome here. these are welcome. they are our brothers and sisters.
Muslims are part of the European Union, and have lived here ever since. Their presence is evidence enough that they have always been a part of 'civilised' Europe.
Muslims make up a very important part of our country and its people. They are our neighbours, our friends. They are our brothers and sisters. They are our future. They are our future Britain.
"Yes, the feminists are saying that the proportion of men in leadership positions is too high in many Western countries. But that is because the problem is structural. The problem is that too many women are being taught to be ""feminine"", thus making it hard for them to succeed."
Any individual may become a terrorist. Religious beliefs do not play part in this.
Islam is a religion that has always been part of our society, and I believe that it should be part of it in the future as well. What is the problem?
Maybe appeasement to people of different faith and beliefs is not such a bad thing. They call it tolerance.
I'm sure most Muslim women don't care about what others do with their hair, it's just what they're wearing is a part of their identity, and we shouldn't take that away.
the european convention on human rights guarantees the same rights of the rights of islam.
Double standards all round lots of British culture and Christian faiths oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures from #equalpay #metoo #timesup job restrictions in the church to condoning/ hiding sexual violence and child exploitation #thetruthproject.
Feminists focus on the empowerment of women rather than on trying to divide society.
Be wary of what you assume others are like. You are no different than any other person you meet. You are allowed to be whatever your heart desires to be.
immigrants contribute to their own culture, having their paying future.
Migrants are not the problem here. The problem is discrimination.
Muslims are part of the European Union, and have lived here ever since. Their presence is evidence enough that they have always been a part of 'civilised' Europe.
There is no scientific evidence to support that Asians are genetically inferior.
Should we 'put all Christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror attacks in the name of their faith? Or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority?
Most feminists are not violent, they share only the struggle for equality.
The Quran does not mention FGM and it is carried out by Christians as well as Muslims. The fact that her parents are Muslim has no bearing on the risk factor.
Another fact is that most innocent defendants (someone who was wrongfully convicted and then released) are African Americans. Innocent black people are seven times more likely to be convicted of murder than innocent white people.
Many migrants come here to work, and not all of them are criminals.
It's not true. They are not the ruling power in the majority of the world and won't be any time soon.
Which evidence do you have that Jews control the U.S. government? They are rather a small but active minority within it.
So your point is they're not like us because they don't have brains?
feminism is the questioning of roles equal rights and to women. children are entitled to decide whether to choose the right to choose.
The far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.
Which evidence do you have that Jews control the U.S. government? They are rather a small but active minority within it.
do you know these muslims are just in the us too. so, do you think muslims are religious or terrorists.
Slavery has been rampant in early societies of all kinds. I am sure the Romans did not take inspiration for their slave trade directly from Muslims.
Should we 'put all Christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror attacks in the name of their faith? Or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority?
The shockingly low number of rape convictions in the UK shows not enough counteraction from the police and gov in rape cases generally, of which the vast majority are not committed by Muslims.
The reason we have migrants in the first place is because they flee from wars we are responsible for.
do you mean all british muslims who follow those british muslims?
what do you mean? there is an influx of migrants are contributing to the economy. it is not about migrants, and we should welcome for them.
religions cannot use violence and violence against violence.
Hollywood is an extremely diverse industry, and Jews are a small but vocal minority of actors, directors, producers, etc. How can you say that Jews control the Hollywood industry?
islam is a evil religion, not a cancer.
this is not not true. homosexuals are not necessarily promiscuous, just as heterosexuals who are homophobic, and feelings, or love.
The statement 'black people are subhuman' is not true. They are human beings with a human value.
There is nothing in the Quran that conflicts with Western culture.
Yeah. But no. Computer says 16% of Muslim women and 11% of Muslim men are unemployed and claiming benefits. If others aren't working then they're not on benefits just being taken care of by hard working family members. As I hope my children will do for me one day (are you listening son?).
Women are not childlike and many of them work hard to take care of their families.
lgbt people should be allowed to live openly their relationships. also, is not a 'choice', but a behavior.
Children are being taught Islam as much as they're being taught about all the other religions. I hardly think this counts as indoctrination.
This is just fear mongering, the problem is not about Islam. The problem is radical Islam and the absence of a strong Islamic identity in our country. We should work together to make the UK more tolerant and Islam less taboo.
muslims contribute a lot to our society. through refer to work and provided through their contributions.
i don't think it has never stating statements that have have sexual orientations and the only are that. how can you say this about an entire religion?
have you ever spoken at a muslim?
the true idea is that women are childlike and still the right to be oppressed and their own being based in their law.
Who has? Nobody has been at war with an entire faith for a thousand years.
What makes 'all' Muslims incompatible with Western society? The vast majority of Muslims in Western society share western values of respect, freedom, tolerance, etc. There are only a few that have extremist anti-West views, these are not representative.
like people that of their skin color are extremely inferior with diversity and identity. don't you think?
Islam is about spreading love and unity, it is not a belief of conquest.
The notion that Jews are trying to subvert our government is completely unfounded. I honestly do not see the link between being Jews and trying to subvert our government.
Being religious has never stopped anyone from being in public office before. Christians have allegiance to God, is that not the same thing?
Any individual may become a terrorist. Religious beliefs do not play part in this.
why are you saying this? islam is not evil. about? hate is not prejudice against violence, it like banning other people.
What exactly is the difference between people of colour and those of other skin colors? How can you be sure that all people of color are bad? We are all biologically the same.
Many faiths are changing to end inequality and persecution of women and gay people and each have people who resist that change. Islam is no better or worse.
Islam is actually a religion about peace, not about hate and violence.
This may be true, but the Jews do not represent the only minority in our upper-middle-class society.
There is no scientific evidence to support that Asians are genetically inferior.
This article sounds like a conspiracy theory. British Muslims just want to live alongside everybody else, there's no 'agenda' to take over.
gays are not necessarily disgusting pricks. they should be said to discrimination.
Immigrants have lived in this country for a very long time. They are proud to be US citizens and immigrants.
Islam - Silence is tacit acceptance. Raise your voice against Islamophobia!
Women are people with dignity, and they deserve respect and protection, just like anybody else.
You don't have to hate gays only because you don't like them. Did they do something to you? I think you have all your rights.
Women are just as capable of feeling emotions as men, and men can likewise be just as empathic.
the notion of racism is an extreme of hate throughout the world. we are all rapists and violent crime and in the uk.
The fact that a person may be disabled does not diminish their right or ability to work.
You may not know, but the NHS is mostly made up of first or second generation immigrants.
To allow other cultures to coexist is a good thing, why should we stop people from getting to know each other?
I'm sure there would be more positive portrayals of Judaism in the media if it were true.
Gays are not disgusting pricks. They are just like any other person.
