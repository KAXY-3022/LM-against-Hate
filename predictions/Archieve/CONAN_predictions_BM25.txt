Refugees are not a burden. We can welcome them and provide for their needs.
even if jews controlled the financial world, hollywood, academia, and the whole solar system, it doesn't mean they are evil, privileged, or greedy people. do you want any facts to that.
In principle, Jewish people are part of the system since they have citizenship, but in practice they are often treated as if they are not our fellow countrymen. The problem is not just about Jewish people, but about the overall attitude towards people of other religions.

Lesbians can also create an environment in which children feel welcome. Instead, we should play our part and try to build a more accepting society.

So race hate started when Westerners could not tolerate other people who had different beliefs?
People have always had different views on the UK and on the world. To suggest that immigrants are replacing the British is the result of racism, saying that they do not fit here is just wishful thinking.

don't you sure that black people are inherently incompatible with western society? they are part of our society without any muslims.
It is not true that blacks are criminals. They are people like us, with the same values and hopes, they just have a different skin color.
We should not judge people for their mental health. It's not a matter of choice for them.
What is that supposed to mean?
Oh, think about it for a while, it's not that simple. Being oppressed is a social problem and requires social change.
There are criminals, who are from UK, raping children and murdering people. Maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes.
They are people too: we all know people in need of help.
Immigrants contribute to the creation of new jobs. That's not a burden.
Perhaps you should check how the people who are mentally ill feel about such things. I suspect that they would prefer that others treated them with respect, rather than with discrimination.

gays are not a religion, just as a mental preference.
That's not true. Thinking that black people are troubled and insensitive are harmful stereotypes.
Jews have been among the greatest innovators and inventors of the modern world, but this doesn't mean they control Hollywood, they are just as entitled to the success of it as other people.
it is a religion that operating by thousands of years ago should be allowed as terrorism. do you have any?
Do you have any proof that the Jews control the U.S. government? It seems highly unlikely to me.

Islam is not a violent religion, and it doesn't want to impose at all.
Coeducation can involve teaching the classmates of children with Down Syndrome to be responsible. As children are often better at approaching children with disabilities than adults, their involvement can be therapeutic, without adding any costs.
Islam is a religion that has had a huge and positive impact on human history and Western culture. To hate a religion is to hate all religions.
i don't think so. the idea is just just terrorists are just against people who rather she's right-wing it might help us to divide opinion.
the feminist movement is an ideology that promotes equality. it's about a way of equality, and respect.

Believing that Jews are running our country is absurd, especially when you consider that the US is a democracy. This seems like a conspiracy theory.

do you think being rapists are being abused without a family or any western society?
This has been going on for a long time and it's a nice way to show people that they are accepted no matter what. I don't see the problem with it.
What about abusive heterosexual parents?

Islam promotes only love and compassion, it's wrong to say otherwise.
They are not a burden, they just want to work. How are they a burden to you?
this is not true. muslims can can come to violence and 'morally but in this has something as a notion of innocent how they do not believe in western religious inequalities are about this kind of it.
What's sick about homosexuals? They just need to be accepted for who they are.
i also have the right to take your own rights to speak of sexual orientation.
How can you think that discriminated children are better off in such schools? It is neither for their own interest nor the other kids who miss the chance of learning to respect diversity.
I'm sure there would be more positive portrayals of Judaism in the media if it were true.
People with learning difficulties are often the ones who help to develop new skills, and in turn help to integrate those new skills into the way we work today.
There is nothing wrong with women wanting to have happy and fulfilling lives, wherever they may be.
A society is built on the cooperation of its members. Be kind to each other and respect each other's differences.
"The West has always been a better place with women as equals. And, if you really want to know why, you could look at the ""Usborne Book of Famous Women"" for example. You would understand."
the recent ignored immigrants are talking about several people fleeing gypsies. their culture and lack of stem is behind perspective promote racism and divide society.
It's not true that the LGBT community is a drain on society. The LGBT community makes a major and positive contribition to our society. I just don't see how this is detrimental.
There are many Muslim people in this country, many good people. If you wanted to get to know Muslims you could start with any Muslim family that lives here. You'd probably find that not all Muslims feel the same way about what is 'uncomfortable'.

in fact, the government who love us to help the poor and children. they are not criminals, they are an integral for the wealth of the u. s. in society.
it is about equality. we can't be proud of being divided for people of color.
our constitution does not tolerate muslims being muslims. to promote peace and understanding. it is also <unk> cultural desire to respect the democratic group.
The idea that women are objects is simply false. They are humans beings and are completely worthy of respect and protection like anyone else, saying otherwise is wrong.
The only thing to be woke about is accepting that the LGBT community exist, rather than being concerned about what they are doing.

How do you know this? Do you have any proof, official papers?

They have always fought for their rights, and for the protection of their culture and way of life, as any european would do. In fact there are many good Gypsy activists who are working to improve their lives. And what we are doing to these people is a malevolent smear campaign, with no common motivation. They are part of European history.
Even if it is a problem for black people to be unemployed, it is a problem for everybody else as well because people of colour are part of society.
