They are welcome in our country, because we are a multicultural society.
women are not to be submissive to men. they are part of this society,
Racism is a system of domination and oppression of some groups over others, and this must be fought. You cannot discriminate against people and claim some alleged privilege based on your skin color.
There are many different kinds of terrorism, and all of them are committed by extremists of various groups, not by Muslims per se.
Gay people are human beings.
They don't, but I wonder why only the crimes with 'White British Non-Muslim' victims are the ones widely circulated?
Islam is not a religion of child molesters, and Muslims are not a 'bundle of child molesters'. Why do you say so?
It is not true that blacks are the source of crime in our society. The problem is violence and poverty, not race.
Many pupils with learning difficulties attend school. This does not prove that others would prefer to attend school if people with difficulties were excluded from the education system.
Like all human people, some women are better than others at certain things, and this does not need fixing by men.
Sorry but this is false. They are here to integrate, not to rape non-believers.
The fact is that Muslims are not overrunning Europe. They are not here to ruin our beautiful and peaceful continent. They are just trying to integrate.
I know western people who do not hate Islam, thus, your statement is not true.
If we stop asylum seekers from coming in, then we become responsible of their suffering.
You can't stop a religion, you can only try to understand and live with Muslims and others who share their religion.
Deportation is a very serious matter. We should not deport people based on their nationality. Of course we should fight crimes when they happen, but discrimination based on race would be a bad decision.
Using intolerance and discrimination against anyone different? Sounds like a western issue.
If there was a religion that celebrated death, then that would need to be banned, but fortunately Islam isn't a death cult so it can't be banned.
Violence against women is a huge problem, not only in Islam.
Immigration doesn't mean letting people in to steal our jobs, but rather, respecting people's right to live and work in the country they choose.
You're wrong about them, they are like any other people. You can't hate people just because they are different from you.
How can you be sure that the Jews control the U.S. government? Being a U.S. citizen does not automatically imply that they control the government.
The notion that white people are different to Jews is simply untrue. We are both human beings.
It doesn't matter who you are. Whether you're a man, a woman or transgender, women are to be treated as human beings.
Islam is a religion of peace, you cannot blame a religion for everything bad that happens.
Migrants are not a burden to our country. Migrants have been proven to be contributing members of society.
Just like everyone else, I am sure Jews are trying to influence the world in a positive way but there is no proof they are the only ones with power in this world.
Even our migrants have been accused of being criminals. It is just prejudice toward strangers.
this isn’t not true. black people are just like us, they are all human beings.
The real problem here is the amount of Islamophobic hate speech that Muslims face, not the book which their beliefs are based on. That is the hate which is having real and dangerous consequences.
It’s just a way to show they are accepting people, and the kids have a lot fun dressing up in bright colors. It’s not sexualisation at all, it is a way to show solidarity.
Small groups of people peacefully gather to pray, but because they do not look like you, you are outraged? Why am I not surprised?
Gay men are not promiscuous. To suggest otherwise is to be grossly generalistic. How many gay men do you know?
It's a myth that all Muslims are terrorists. We need to understand that all religions have had terrorists in them.
There are some examples of non-peaceful groups in Islam: for example ISIL, a group that has carried out a lot of terrorist attacks and killed many people. However, I don't think they represent all Muslims and I definitely don't think that peaceful Muslims can't exist too.
So you think women are childlike because they are submissive? No they are not. They are strong and independent, just like men.
Maybe you should consider that not all women are childlike, and that some women are 'childlike' with children!
Have you forgot that this country respects people of all religions?
The Quran says to love your neighbour as yourself. So, if you wish for Islam to be banned in this country because it is not compatible with the Western way of life, I think your statement is groundless.
We shouldn't accept the idea that women are subhuman. They are human beings like men and deserve to be seen as such.
In every country in the world Muslims should be welcome, and they're not less welcome here because of their religion.
Muslims, in my opinion, do not want to take over our country. They are only here as guest workers.
What about guaranteeing equal access to health care, education and so on, in order to build a democratic state?
Islam has existed alongside and within western civilisation for centuries. The scapegoating of Muslims as a threat is what is really worrying in our society.
We are a country that is inclusive of immigrants. Why shouldn't they come to our country?
How many unemployed 'lazy' Muslims do you know? There are no more work-shy muslims than there are people of any other faith.
Do you really think that Muslims are any less human than us? Muslims deserve to live just as people of other faiths.
If a person believes they have no place in a country then they must be very worried. How would you feel if all the people you love left you, or if you were obliged to leave the person and the country you love?
Women should be allowed to choose their own looks. But to suggest that this is not their right, or that we should make them submissive to some men is just inhuman.
Where did you get that idea? The reason it’s sometimes publicised when a holocaust survivor speaks about their experience is because there aren’t many of them, especially now when most survivors have passed away.
Jews are a part of our society, and they contribute to our economy. How is it possible to see the world without them?
I cannot agree that rape gangs are made up only from Muslims. People of all nationalities can become criminals. We should deal with it without making racist statements.
Islam is to blame ...For wanting a society that is tolerant, diverse, muticultural. It just seems like common sense to me?
Even if Muslims are the second religious group in the UK, they are a minority in the country. According to the 2019 census, there are 3 million Muslims in the UK (5% of the population). And, last but not least: we can't isolate people just because of their religion.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Why do you say that they are never taken responsible? Crimes are punished irregardless of religion in our country. If a Muslim person kills or oppresses someone, they will be prosecuted and punished.
Muslims already live in many European countries, and they are not banned. Why should we ban them from here?
There's the same proportion of criminals among muslims as it is among western people. You cannot say that Muslims are doing terrorism and raping children, this is simply exaggeration.
Islam - Silence is tacit acceptance. Raise your voice against Islamophobia!
It is not true that Jews control the world economy. There are hundreds of thousands of diverse people working in leading roles for the governments, companies and institutions composing the world economy.
I can understand that you’re frustrated – austerity has hit so many of us horribly, but your blame is directed to the wrong people. Migrants are statistically less likely to claim benefits, plus they’re not easy to access anyway. Most people receiving benefits in the UK are actually in work, direct your anger towards better pay and conditions!
Immigrants come here to work and pay taxes. They are more than welcome here.
All religions have value and are welcome to our country. To be clear: Islam is not a religion that is against the whole world.
Many immigrants come here to work and have a better life. Why do you think we have to stop migration?
there are many different races, and beliefs are not compatible with an same world.
What are you talking about? Islam does not promote these crimes. The Quran, Hadith, Sunnah and the like condemn or at least warn against these heinous crimes.
We are taking in refugees. And refugees are welcome.
Many of them are working hard or working to complete their studies, is this lazy to you?
You could say that about any person, Muslim or not. According to the government, far right extremism is a bigger terrorist threat than Muslims. Does that make you a potential terrorist?
Not all black people are bad. Not all black people are criminals. Not all black people are violent. Being aware that there are people different from you is a good thing.
Wrong: homosexuality is a sexual orientation, not a mental illness.
"If a man is raped we call it rape, and consider him the victim; when a woman is raped we call it a ""misunderstanding"" and she is considered the culprit. Shouldn't the fault be that of the rapist, regardless of gender?"
Women are not childlike, in fact, they are often the key to success for their families. Also, they have the right to exit their homes if they wish.
To the contrary, we have been trading with Muslim nations for hundreds of years, often at times when we were at war with other European nations.
All countries have the right to host refugees from outside their borders, since these people are persecuted within their own borders.
muslims are just as entitled to talk as anyone else, they are just trying to drive.
Migrants are not a burden to our country. Migrants have been proven to be contributing members of society.
Muslims already live in many European countries, and they are not banned. Why should we ban them from here?
Women are allowed to vote, why should the government discriminate against them?
I don't think the world would be a better place without immigrants. From what I understand, they often bring positive changes to the world.
Health care should be given to people who are in need. Black people are not at fault for anything.
any belief of a certain race or ethnicity being superior to another is problematic, not just white supremacy.
That's a gross generalisation, and not at all true, homosexuals are not sick and it's never acceptable to treat them like this.
It's definitely a disgrace that in such a rich country we leave homeless people on the streets, especially when there's actually enough housing for everyone it's just not distributed properly. Migrants don't have an easy time either though, and it's not their fault that the government ignores homelessness as an issue.
islam is a peaceful religion. it is never the practice for islam, and hatred it is totally wrong with culture.
Who can say that Muslims are privileged? They are reminded too often that their religion is not welcome here. I do not see where you find double standards as all criminals are judged and punished, Muslim criminals are also judged by their own community.
Being gay isn't a mental illness, it's a perfectly normal lifestyle.
There is no proof that Islam as a religion is violent. Instead, those who know it agrees that it is a peaceful religion.
Jews are very human and deserve respect, like anyone else.
Maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society.
muslims are not part of our society, they are not of that.
I am tired of the deliberate lies or appalling lack of understanding about a religion followed by 23% of the world. Enough IS ENOUGH!
The real problem here is the amount of Islamophobic hate speech that Muslims face, not the book which their beliefs are based on. That is the hate which is having real and dangerous consequences.
I don't think Jews operate with impunity and free from criticism since the state of Israel keeps getting critized (however right or wrong, it's not the focus).
women are not to be submissive to men. they are part of this society,
The majority of people of color who live here are contributing members of our society. Why shouldn't they live here?
Why are you attacking muslims? Many people come and live in Britain and I do not see why it is a bad thing.
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
this is not true. they are human, and they are still capable of people who come over the country.
Or maybe children who have Down syndrome are at higher risk of physical abuse and bulling.
Many refugees and migrants are actually happy to work for Europe. Many have jobs for which it would have been difficult to find laborforce if they were not welcome in here.
Homosexuals are not sick, they just need to be accepted for who they are.
jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are a collection of people of different people, and their beliefs that can be respected.
Immigrants contribute to the creation of new jobs. That's not a burden.
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
muslim people are incompatible with any religion.
There are many Muslims living in our country, and they have always been a part of our society. We should not be scapegoating Muslims.
Why do you think Jews control the US government? Do you have any proof?
In every country in the world Muslims should be welcome, and they're not less welcome here because of their religion.
this is just true. i do not think this is an ideology at all. it is very clear that islam is a muslim, like christianity and islam condemned western laws on the rule the religion.
A lot of Muslims live in the UK, and we are a cosmopolitan society. Muslims are not a 'uncivilised' people, they simply have different beliefs than you.
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
Women succeed in business, politics, etc. No-one gets government contracts because they are bad or incompetent, but because they are good or intelligent. There are many women leaders. Think about it.
there is no evidence that islam is incompatible with western culture. it is a cultural ideology that has nothing to do with terrorism.
Being gay doesn't affect blood receivers! It's not like being gay is in your blood. Gay people are the same as regular people and if they really wanted to donate, then they should because it can help society.
It's not 'all the times' that white people tell Black people to shut up, but it is a large group of white people that still constantly remind Black people that they are inferior.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
I think that's a rather personal attack on the lesbian community, which is not helpful in any way.
It is not true that blacks are criminals. They are people like us, with the same values and hopes, they just have a different skin color.
every islamophobic person has nothing to do with islam,
Many migrants come to this country to work, provide for their families and access the benefits system only if necessary. They are more than welcome here as long as they integrate.
Muslims are no more likely to be reliant on benefits or social housing than the non-Muslim British population. Stop trying to depict Muslims as a drain on our national resources and try and consider the positive contributions they make.
They are not a burden, they just want to work. How are they a burden to you?
A society is composed of people playing different parts, and most of them value diversity. Blacks aren't inferior only because of the color of their skin, that's completely false.
Migrants are welcome here, regardless of their origin.
Islam is a religion that has had a huge and positive impact on human history and Western culture. To hate a religion is to hate all religions.
I can understand the feeling of fear that is often caused by all the hate speech that is being spewed through the media, but we don't need to hate religions. Islam is a free, open and tolerant faith that has come to our country. We do not have to choose to hate it.
This is just a myth spread by the so-called 'anti gay' movement. They are trying to create a climate of fear by using this unjustified arguments, but it is not helping to build a more just society.
Women succeed in business, politics, etc. No-one gets government contracts because they are bad or incompetent, but because they are good or intelligent. There are many women leaders. Think about it.
Why should we care? We can count on the British government to promote our values and protect us from the effects of radical Islam (if this is what you had in mind).
Refugees are often very contributing people in our society. We should welcome them, not exclude them.
islam is not a muslim organization. peace is a religion of christianity and hate.
People with physical disabilities are human and can feel pain. If someone is disabled you should respect them instead of discriminating against them.
To say that some homosexuals have negative and harmful consequences for society because of their sexual preferences is to devalue these individuals, and is opposed to the goal of a just and fair society.
Jews have always inhabited many countries around the world. Their presence has been a part of our history and they should be respected, not hated.
We have always been a nation of immigrants, and it is a proud tradition to welcome immigrants from around the world. This is because we give value to human rights.
Women should be treated as equal in life.
Gays hope to be accepted by the heterosexual community, but it's difficult seeing that many people think like you.
This is demonstrably false. Muslims make up around 12% of unemployed people in the UK - the vast majority work hard and contribute to the UK economy.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
You cannot be racist towards an ideology. You can, however, be discriminatory and intolerant towards the people that follow it.
Non-muslims are the ones who used slavery to build the foundations of western society and relied on it to advance capitalism. What is your point?
Why do you think it is because of Muslims? To me, globalization and tourism would explain more why Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs'.
You don't have to hate gays only because you don't like them. Did they do something to you? I think you have all your rights.
The real problem is that the NHS has been underfunded for years, since health tourism actually only takes 0.3% of the budget. You can't blame migrants for a funding problem.
why do you think they come to be considered because of their religion or not.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
Do you really know what you are talking about? This is often work without fair wages and poor conditions, the cynical exploitation of the vulnerable and desperate.
There is no proof that immigrants are responsible for the problems we are having in Europe.
how can you say it? feminism is an entire faith?
Islam's core values are similar to Western values. To say that Islam is ruining Western culture is a complete and total distortion of the truth.
it is a religious ideology that promotes violence and violence.
the vast majority of muslims are peaceful.
The media are full of the rumours of rape and abuse committed by Muslim. The problem is not about Islam. It is about violence.
The overwhelming majority of Muslims live in Western societies. They are our fellow citizens.
Why do you think that the number of immigrants in the UK has increased? Have you seen any statistics on this?
The fact that a person may be disabled does not diminish their right or ability to work.
If you have a deep conversation with Muslims, you will know they are different from what you think. Have you thought about that if they could stay safely in their country, would they want to move to other countries and start new life in a completely new place?
Terrorism is always a threat. Why do you think that Muslims want to kill us? They aren't all terrorists.
[quote from Quran about peace and love.] When the Quran says nothing about harming people who do not believe in Islam, how is this a reflection on all Muslims.?
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
To use an old saying, you cannot be 'European' and be a 'racist'.
This is demonstrably false. Muslims make up around 12% of unemployed people in the UK - the vast majority work hard and contribute to the UK economy.
The fact is, there are many Muslims living in European countries as a valuable part of the community. Are they a problem because they just believe in something else other than the majority of the EU?
It is wrong to say that blacks are a sickness. They are just as capable of thinking for themselves as anyone else, and they deserve to have more prominent roles in society.
What you are saying is that white people do not find it strange to treat black people like this, when this is not acceptable. People of color are our brothers and sisters.
Violating of right for underrepresented communities (homosexuals, women, disabled people) takes place everywhere, and many native Western people are also held accountable for it. Oppressing rights is not the feature of Islam but of our society in general.
Not all Muslims rape and molest people. But if it is a community you don't want to be in, it is your free choice.
Black people are not bad. They are not criminals. They are not violent. They are different from us in some aspects, but it's good to be aware of differences.
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
the world would be a better place without that ungrounded sayings and misdirected hate.
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
islam is a religion of peace. muslims should have a part of our country. that we should learn that of discriminating based on their private beliefs and beliefs.
There's the same proportion of criminals among muslims as it is among western people. You cannot say that Muslims are doing terrorism and raping children, this is simply exaggeration.
isn't because that minority are responsible for all muslims. criminals are just representative of all muslims. black people are honestly just as trying to ruin them.
Islam - Silence is tacit acceptance. Raise your voice against Islamophobia!
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
Muslim terrorists have struck in Paris and London, killing scores of innocent people, that's true. We must root out terrorists before they destroy our country, that's also true. But we cannot target innocent people just because of their faith, otherwise we'd be no better than the terrorists that we seek to neutralize.
Using intolerance and discrimination against anyone different? Sounds like a western issue.
The attack of women against men? Have you ever heard of feminists being against men? That's not what feminism is about.
Do you really think that Muslims are any less human than us? Muslims deserve to live just as people of other faiths.
If migrants do not want to work, then why there are many doing jobs we don't want to do?
Women are oppressed, feminists don't want to oppress men. Their rights are not changing overnight.
This is a myth, immigrants are not taking our jobs. In fact, immigration has been a huge success story for the UK economy.
You are generalizing too much. Christian people are also known to rape children and murder people! But we know that such cases are exceptions and not a rule. I think the same is true about Muslims.
Muslims are welcome here, and many of them already live here, so why shouldn't we welcome them? Why should we be so intolerant of people who are already integrated here?
jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are a collection of people of different people, and their beliefs that can be respected.
islam promotes violence against women and women. anyone can feel their sexual preferences.
muslims come to our country, and many of them are looking for them. how should they stop them living into our country of society.
Dear friend, first of all, sharia law and Islam are not extreme. Sharia law is guidance for the goal of leading humanity close to God and to live in kindness and justice with God's creation. Second of all, jihad, based on the concept of Muslim, means struggle for the advancement of oneself within the guidelines of Islam. All these reveal that Islam is a peaceful religion.
Rape and violence against women is a problem everywhere. We cannot just blame migrants.
Muslims have contributed to our country, and they are part of the fabric of our society. To suggest they are a 'chronic threat' is just wrong.
There are many Muslims living in the UK, and most of them are good people. Why do you think we shouldn't accept them here?
This is not true, only a handful of Muslims have been abusing women. We mustn't spread hate based on generalisation.
So many of the gay couples that are giving kids great lives do it through adoption, so why do you think they shouldn't adopt?
it is not true that blacks are criminals.
We shouldn't accept the idea that women are subhuman. They are human beings like men and deserve to be seen as such.
There are many different kinds of terrorism, and all of them are committed by extremists of various groups, not by Muslims per se.
This is not true. Migrants are an important part of our society. Migrants have worked hard to build our country. They are our brothers and sisters. We should welcome them.
Not all rapists are black and not all black are rapists. Skin color doesn't make you a criminal.
Do you think it is OK to be racist against someone based on their religion? I am confused. There are white and black Muslims, like there are white and black Christians.
Migrants are fleeing from war and poverty. They are entitled to seek refuge in the EU. They should be protected, not banned.
It's not true that they want to rule the world. They are a small but important part of humanity. We all make mistakes: believing in Antisemitic canards is one of these.
women aren't human beings like us, and they have the right to have their rights.
You can't judge people by their faith. This is just another example of xenophobia, the real problem concerning integration.
Women should be allowed to choose their own looks. But to suggest that this is not their right, or that we should make them submissive to some men is just inhuman.
Islam is not violent. There can be violent religious extremists, but this happens in all religions.
Muslims have been a part of European society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them.
Migrants fleeing war and poverty are coming here for help and a second chance at life. Why would they want the country where they are living to fail?
No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!
No, Muslims want to be able to eat halal, but they don’t care if everyone eats it. What makes you think that?
islam have a peaceful religion. it is a war.
This is a lie spread by anti-semites and it's been proved many times over that the Jews have no monopoly of the world.
Jews are a part of our society, and they contribute to our economy. How is it possible to see the world without them?
muslims are part of our society, for their fellow diversity. they are part of western society and share our values though they are helped to understand it. should not be welcome them, are welcome learning and contribute to the society i do not think so.
If you really wanted to preserve our beautiful land you could build a wall and bar OUR people from it. US citizens are the main cause of our problems.
women are not to be submissive to men. they are part of this society,
We are not at war with Islam. Islam is a religion, and people are free to choose which religion to follow.
the vast majority of muslims are peaceful.
Islam is not a bad religion, nor is it a false religion.
Migrants are not a burden to our country. Migrants have been proven to be contributing members of society.
It's not true that all black people are aggressive. Also, the majority of our population is white, we don't need that much protection.
Black people get stopped by the police for no reason other than being black. Muslims get surveyed by PREVENT just for being Muslim. Anyone would think English law has been persecuting Muslims for hundreds of years.
Jews are persecuted all around the world, but what you say is not based on facts.
Being gay isn't a mental illness, it's a perfectly normal lifestyle.
The EU is a great success story, it has given birth to some of the greatest ideas in history, and is the envy of the world thanks to Muslims as well. We should let those ideas and achievements speak for themselves.
So you think women are childlike because they are submissive? No they are not. They are strong and independent, just like men.
This kind of campaigns is an opportunity for positive change. This is nothing new, and we should all try to learn from black history month.
There are many Muslims living in our country, and they have always been a part of our society. We should not be scapegoating Muslims.
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
The majority of the people arrested for drug smuggling are poor. Those arrested for crime in general are not generally poor. Maybe this phenomenon has to do more with poverty than with the colour of their skin.
That's what we used to do: we asked people to assimilate our culture but now we accept their differences. Transgender people just want to live without having any harm done to them, so I think it's useless for them to try to integrate more than they already did
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
As a matter of fact, we couldn't manage without immigrants. Most of our NHS staff are immigrants. The health system would collapse without migrant workers.
Immigrants contribute to the creation of new jobs. That's not a burden.
gays are human and deserve respect.
why would you say the jews control the cause.
Why would it? The Koran is a peaceful religious book.
even if jews controlled the financial world, hollywood, academia, and the whole solar system, it doesn't mean they are evil, privileged, or greedy people. do you want any facts to that.
Saying this will never improve people's well-being. Gay people aren't committing crimes, they are just trying to get people to accept them.
I think the idea that we should keep fighting those people is absurd. Maybe instead we should concentrate on developing our culture.
it is a religious ideology that promotes violence and violence.
That is a conspiracy theory that has no basis at all! Jews are part of society, and are valued for who they are. They have a special place in history and culture, but this doesn't mean that you can blame them for everything.
The only ones against Islam and Muslims are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is.
Gay people are a danger to children only if they abuse them, which isn't the case. Yours is a generalization.
Using intolerance and discrimination against anyone different? Sounds like a western issue.
Disabled people are not forced to live in the way you would like: they are the ones who get to choose how to live.
Women are allowed to vote, why should the government discriminate against them?
It is not true that gays are a burden to society. On the contrary, many LGBT people are contributing members of our society. This is why we need a safe space for everyone to feel accepted.
Feminism is not a divisive movement. Women can do the same as men and that is a fact.
I am not sure that they should be banned. Migrants are people too. They are good to have in our society. And many of them are helping us to develop our country.
Foreigners have expressed concern for women's rights, and it is not surprising that they want to have access to health care and education, since they care for their children as well.
muslim people are incompatible with any religion.
Or maybe they're just lesbians so they're not interested in men? You can't force someone to be something they're not, and it doesn't affect you if they choose to be in same sex relationships.
well, we are not lazy, we are allowed to live and work in the country. why do we target your facts based on them?
The country has always had a strong Muslim population, and Muslims are proud to be part of it. They are more than welcome here.
Feminism is a movement towards equality, not hate.
Well that is not true. A woman's career choices should be respected, even if they are not always popular.
homosexuality is not a disease. that's a sexual preference.
Anyone who says that the major problem in the UK is with Muslim rape gangs is either intentionally lying or trying to deflect attention from the problem of violence against women.
Christian Europeans are the ones that then expanded the slave trade to an industrial scale and instrumentalised exploitation as a key component of our economy.
We will not know until the next census by recent survey suggest that the UK is increasingly a secular society with a growing percentage expressing no religous affiliation at all.
islam has only many exceptions, islam, and there is no 'invasion'.
Muslims don't want to 'take over', even if they abide by sharia themselves, they're just trying to live alongside everybody else
Children with Down Syndrome would not feel different as long as they are respected and are not put down by the others.
We shouldn't accept the idea that women are subhuman. They are human beings like men and deserve to be seen as such.
The idea that migrants are merely happy-go-lucky people with no code of their own is just wrong.
People can choose their own lives, and this is their right. Children raised by same sex couple thrive in the same way as children of heterosexual couples.
True: there are more immigrants living in the U.S. than ever before. Still, the percentage of immigrants in the overall population is not much different than other times in our history. Today immigrants make up approximately 13% of the U.S. population. From 1900 to 1930, immigrants made up 12-15% of the population, and similar spikes occurred in the 1850s and 1880s. During those periods immigrants successfully became part of American society, helping us to build the thriving country we live in.
Health care should be given to people who are in need. Black people are not at fault for anything.
islam is a peaceful religion. it is never the practice for islam, and hatred it is totally wrong with culture.
there are many jobs that are exploiting our country.
Gay people are part of our society, and they are valued for who they are. Their opinions and lifestyles are very important to us.
Bloody retribution? Most people of all faiths are just getting on with their lives and a tiny minority like your comment seems to be trying to create conflict. But I do not think any of you are winning.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
This statement is not true. Islam is a peaceful religion, and it is an accepted religion in all countries because of that.
Islam is a religion, and all religions are about love, not hate.
islam is but not true and promotes oppression and intolerance.
It is not true that all migrants are criminals, they are hard-working people.
It is true that people are driven to the right, and the right promote this view. But I did not hear about any people being banned for criticism. Rapism and terrorism are discussed in our society and Muslim society and no one makes anyone silent.
That is a conspiracy theory that has no basis at all! Jews are part of society, and are valued for who they are. They have a special place in history and culture, but this doesn't mean that you can blame them for everything.
immigrants are not welcome in this country, and they do not want that control in society.
There is a problem with Islam and English society, but it is not about Islam, it is about the unjustified fear and hate towards other religions.
jews are not taking our jobs. they are our brothers and sisters. we should respect them.
The statement 'black people are subhuman' is not true. They are human beings with a human value.
It's called diversity and it's healthy, the sooner we start welcoming new people, the sooner we'll find a better solution to world problems.
Your words are indicative of a climate of fear against Muslims. They're just humans like you, how are you afraid of them?
Immigrants contribute to the creation of new jobs. That's not a burden.
Why do you think it is because of Muslims? To me, globalization and tourism would explain more why Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs'.
Terrorism is always a threat. Why do you think that Muslims want to kill us? They aren't all terrorists.
The media are full of the rumours of rape and abuse committed by Muslim. The problem is not about Islam. It is about violence.
women aren't full human rights and deserve respect.
This is demonstrably false. Muslims make up around 12% of unemployed people in the UK - the vast majority work hard and contribute to the UK economy.
i don't think the lgbt+ people don't be excluded. because they are human beings.
I don't think the world would be a better place without immigrants. From what I understand, they often bring positive changes to the world.
islam is a religion of peace. feminism is a religion of conquest.
Jews have been among the greatest innovators and inventors of the modern world, but this doesn't mean they control Hollywood, they are just as entitled to the success of it as other people.
This is not true. Migrants are an important part of our society. Migrants have worked hard to build our country. They are our brothers and sisters. We should welcome them.
In many Western societies there are Muslim, and these societies are in many ways more democratic than religiously homogeneous ones. Muslims are not incompatible with Western societies.
The media are full of the rumours of rape and abuse committed by Muslim. The problem is not about Islam. It is about violence.
do you think that islam is positively infecting our planet?
There is no need to ban gays from Europe and US. It is simply not appropriate to treat gays like this.
The only thing Muslims are trying to 'win' is the right to exist free from discrimination and dehumanising hate like this.
Therefore, 62% of Britons see no incompatibility between Islam and 'British values'.
Although Muslims are often accused of being not loyal to our country, they are just as proud to be British as anybody else. They are proud to be part of our society.
I'm not convinced that immigration has a lot to do with the fact that the education system is under pressure. Maybe the government should fund it better, because I don't see the connection between pupil spending going down and migration.
islam is a religion of peace, and tolerance, muslims are terrorists.
The notion that feminism is about women hating men is just nonsense. Feminism is about the right to life of every human being.
You can't blame people of color for being weak, this is racism. Black people are people as is anybody else.
Immigrants are not invading our country. They are just trying to live their life as is best for them.
Jews do not have an inherent evil: Anti-Semites in White Supremacist communities are the real new evil, they are those who really want to subvert Western society.
The real problem is not same-sex marriage, it is people being homophobic.
jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are a part of society and should want to be respected.
Who is 'we', surely it was men and women working together that built civilisation? Why is it you think being 'soft' is a problem? Everyone is entitled to their emotions, and men shouldn't have to 'man up'.
Women are people, and people are human. Being oppressed is not a choice. You may think it's a badge of honour to be called a man, but it should not be a badge of shame to be called woman.
The 100 million pounds they donated to charity on Ramadan must be part of that evil plan to blow everyone up.
Please don't speak on my behalf. They live here, pay taxes and work. Do you really want to take the country back from the people who contributed to bringing it into being?
Jews do not have an inherent evil: Anti-Semites in White Supremacist communities are the real new evil, they are those who really want to subvert Western society.
which is an unusual thought. people. muslims are welcome. they are
Muslims, in my opinion, do not want to take over our country. They are only here as guest workers.
Gay people do exist in this country, and we respect their right to live and love who they want. However, I do not think that yours is an appropriate moral statement for our environment.
I'd think the root of all the world problems today is over-population and ecology. Why do you blame Islam in all the problems?
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
If you hate someone because of their religion, you should be ashamed of your hate. We should all be proud of our humanity.
islam is a evil religion, not a cancer.
People find fault in people of any religion. But the problem is not with religion. The problem is blaming migrants because they are Muslims. This Islamophobic climate has reached a crisis state. We must step in and stop it.
"Would be intersting to see how much money ""foreigners"" are giving the UK in terms of taxes. It's not hard to see how much we have to thank them for. Would be beneficial for everyone to focus on stopping tax evasion instead."
Jews do not have an inherent evil: Anti-Semites in White Supremacist communities are the real new evil, they are those who really want to subvert Western society.
You can't blame people of color for being weak, this is racism. Black people are people as is anybody else.
In my opinion, Islam is a religion of peace. If it were a religion that promotes hatred, then it would be banned.
In my opinion, Islam is a religion of peace. If it were a religion that promotes hatred, then it would be banned.
Islam - Silence is tacit acceptance. Raise your voice against Islamophobia!
There is no evidence that Islam is a religion of violence, and people can be violent even without any knowledge of Islam.
not all migrants are incompetent and we should also focus at the whole of community here can live in a small percentage. how can you think so?
Islam is not about killing infidels. It is about peace and freedom of religion for all.
the majority of immigrants who want to have our jobs.
would you say the same thing to say, because of the actions of your religion? i can you insult muslims that being homophobic and discrimination would unsafe in muslim communities. this is not wrong. you should get things that way would be damaged by one person there.
There are multiple strains of Islam and we should not be afraid of all of them. And if you would like to know more about Islam, you should talk to a Muslim.
"Jews might feel different as a minority, and sometimes they are misunderstood because of their cultural and religious differences. This is their being ""special""."
Or maybe children who have Down syndrome are at higher risk of physical abuse and bulling.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Women cannot be denied the right to vote, it is a human right.
if you burn people in this country will be preoccupied by their faith.
That is not what feminism is about. Feminism is about the legitimate empowerment of women, in order for them to have the same rights as men.
The Quran does not advocate that Muslims are inherently violent people, nor does the Hadith prove that Islam is a violent faith. Islam is a religion that promotes tolerance and respect for other faiths.
We should not welcome people who overtly pose a threat to our society, but we cannot ban all the migrants in principle.
No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!
I am not sure what you think the West will be the 'winner' of. Islam isn't in competition with Western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear.
Migration is an important part of modern life. Our country is made of many people, not just one people. To imply that someone says that it is 'racist' to discuss the concept of migrants is just wrong.
Jews are not in charge of the media or the government. At least not in the United States of America.
islam is not a disease, it is a faith of hate.
No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!
Using intolerance and discrimination against anyone different? Sounds like a western issue.
Many Muslims died in terrorist attacks such as 9/11 in the US and 7/7 in the UK.
"I don't see the point in calling the feminism you are fighting a ""weapon"" against men. Your argument is that women do not want equality, because they do not want to live under men but to subjugate them. And this is something you have to prove."
homosexuality is not a disease, it is a love.
Grooming gangs like those in Rochdale and Huddersfield have been rightfully convicted. Does that look like police collusion to you?
"The 14th Amendment of the US Constitution, known as ""birthright citizenship"" provides that ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside"". Many people believe that immigrants want to exploit this right by coming here, and yet the vast majority of immigrants to the U.S. happens for economic reasons or to escape violence and poverty. As a result, immigration tends to increase when the US economy is booming and to decrease when it doesn't do so well, which shows that the findings about people coming for economic opportunities are true."
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
"Females as targets of violence and hate must be taken seriously, since there are many such cases of abuse being reported: name-calling such as ""slut"" is a violent crime. Is this what men are for: to dominate and oppress with violence?"
women are human beings with respect. they have rights.
I don't understand why women are always told what they have to do. Women are humans with rights that need to be respected.
Feminism is a movement created to improve the standard of living for women. Feminists are human beings and there are no imposters (apart from those who seek to demonize women for claiming their right).
muslims come to our country, and many of them are looking for them. how should they stop them living into our country of society.
Jews are a part of our society, and they contribute to our economy. How is it possible to see the world without them?
There are multiple strains of Islam and we should not be afraid of all of them. And if you would like to know more about Islam, you should talk to a Muslim.
Immigrants come here to work and pay taxes. They are more than welcome here.
muslims are part of our society, for their fellow diversity. they are part of western society and share our values though they are helped to understand it. should not be welcome them, are welcome learning and contribute to the society i do not think so.
Hollywood is an extremely diverse industry, and Jews are a small but vocal minority of actors, directors, producers, etc. How can you say that Jews control the Hollywood industry?
the vast majority of muslims worldwide are peaceful and without violence.
What makes you think that? Besides, I am sure Islam is more than just trouble.
Immigrants are just like us, they have given their lives for our country. It is their right to be happy and to choose for themselves.
Gays are not a disease. Homosexuality is a sexual orientation.
the vast majority of muslims are peaceful.
Gays are not a burden on the health system. The focal point is practicing safe sex, sexual orientation has nothing to do with it.
they deserve human beings deserve respect. don't you think so?
No they are not, they contribute to our economy and are welcome here, despite how bad they are treated.
It depends on who you ask. For example, there are many Muslims who have helped fight for our country and defend us from terrorist attacks.
The real problem here is the amount of Islamophobic hate speech that Muslims face, not the book which their beliefs are based on. That is the hate which is having real and dangerous consequences.
Maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society.
Since we are comfortable with animals in our society, we should consider whether it is fair to put mentally disabled people in a cage like this. Or would you consider disabled a bigger risk even than some aggressive dog breeds that can circulate freely?
The word 'slave' has nothing to do with what you think it does. Slavery was an institution created to oppress people of different races and religions, and is now banned in Europe. To suggest that it should exist because of a minority of men is an act of disrespect of human rights.
You don't have to hate gays only because you don't like them. Did they do something to you? I think you have all your rights.
poverty, brexit, austerity, homelessness. please enlighten me as the powerful muslim would not solve these problems.
it is a religious ideology that promotes violence and violence.
Why do you think the world would be a better place without Jews? They are part of our society and rightfully so, it wouldn't be acceptable to exclude part of the population.
You could say that about any person, Muslim or not. According to the government, far right extremism is a bigger terrorist threat than Muslims. Does that make you a potential terrorist?
Feminism is not anti-men. Feminists are anti-oppression.
For the last years black people have been denied basic rights and their representation has declined dramatically. Black people have become second class citizens. It is time to give black people back the basic rights they should have always had the right to enjoy.
Gay people are people just like you and me. You don't have a problem with being gay, do you?
Many Muslims live in the UK and we have a lot in common, and what is different between us is not a reason for discrimination.
The feminism does not inhibit the imagination, it promotes inclusive ideas and inclusive ideas promote a more equal society.
Far-right extremism has been named by the government as the biggest terrorist threat to the UK. These are the people you should be looking out for not, Muslims.
Are you forced to pray in a Mosque? Or observe all the rules? As far as I see it, Muslims follow their traditions, that is their right, but they do not convert anyone in our society.
What you are saying is not true about the culture in general. Not all islamic people are like that and it is not true to claim such facts. Moreover, many non-islamic people can be blaimed for being intolerant, sexist, etc. Should we deal with them first and then turn to Islamic criminals?
Not all Muslims are from the Middle East, like not all Muslims are from Pakistan. And to equate all Muslims with extremists is misleading.
"The fact that some women don't want the protection of the law should not negate their right to live their life as they wish. In my opinion, woman are people too and this ""men's rights"" stuff is just an excuse to oppress and marginalize all women once more."
I don't think Jews operate with impunity and free from criticism since the state of Israel keeps getting critized (however right or wrong, it's not the focus).
maybe we should try to eradicate immigrants? it's not because they are excluding lgbt people, their partner or a citizen.
Far right extremism is just a nasty stain on humanity.
Refugees are often very contributing people in our society. We should welcome them, not exclude them.
This is just fear mongering, the problem is not about Islam. The problem is radical Islam and the absence of a strong Islamic identity in our country. We should work together to make the UK more tolerant and Islam less taboo.
This is a myth, immigrants are not taking our jobs. In fact, immigration has been a huge success story for the UK economy.
How exactly is the government submitting to this? I do not see Muslims oppressing these groups and this being tolerated, in fact it seems Muslims are the group being oppressed and vilified.
anyone can locate muslims who migrate to live in the country, for example, when they are doing their lot in our society. they have their right to say so.
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Migrants come here to work and pay taxes. They don't deserve to be called 'a burden'.
Islam is a peaceful religion. It is not about oppressing anyone.
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
Gay people are human beings.
this is not true. the immigrants come here and work there.
muslims are welcome and deserve respect, because they don't don't have to be hated by them.
Your statement is FALSE. They are guiltless victims of the 'influx of refugees' paranoia. They are European and have been persecuted for centuries. They have always fought for their rights, and for the protection of their culture and way of life, as any european would do. In fact there are many good Gypsy activists who are working to improve their lives. And what we are doing to these people is a malevolent smear campaign, with no common motivation. They are part of European history.
muslims and their families are not in many religions, but they are proud of that.
Jews have always been part of European society, and continue to be today. To suggest that they are incapable of coexisting as equals with us is simply wrong.
We shouldn't discriminate like that. Our culture is all about equality and inclusivity.
Muslims are welcome here, and many of them already live here, so why shouldn't we welcome them? Why should we be so intolerant of people who are already integrated here?
Not all Muslims are extremists, just like not all Christians are good people.
You can't stop a religion, you can only try to understand and live with Muslims and others who share their religion.
Deportation is a very serious matter. We should not deport people based on their nationality. Of course we should fight crimes when they happen, but discrimination based on race would be a bad decision.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
There's the same proportion of criminals among muslims as it is among western people. You cannot say that Muslims are doing terrorism and raping children, this is simply exaggeration.
islam is a peaceful religion. it is never the practice for islam, and hatred it is totally wrong with culture.
There are many Muslims living in the UK, and most of them are good people. Why do you think we shouldn't accept them here?
So you think women are childlike because they are submissive? No they are not. They are strong and independent, just like men.
islam is a peaceful religion of peace, and destruction and intolerance.
Why do you think it is because of Muslims? To me, globalization and tourism would explain more why Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs'.
This is such a tired excuse everyone one of those so called 'Muslims are offended by the flag' stories two minutes on google shows its always one person's word, never any evidence, loads of examples of other people with the same flag and often the fact that it was hung in a dangerous way, they punched a security guard, or pissed on the floor was not the reason why they were asked to leave.
it is a religious ideology that promotes violence and violence.
Women should be allowed to choose their own looks. But to suggest that this is not their right, or that we should make them submissive to some men is just inhuman.
Does the 'solution' for the economic crisis revolve around paying the migrants to leave? It is not clear how this could solve to the real problems of our country.
People dress in drag and at Pride to have fun and show support to the LGBT community, so it has nothing to do with sexualisation. Children and adults can all have fun at pride.
not all jews are evil and are just wrong. so we have strong in hate like this. why do you know that?
Teaching about LGBT relationships in schools isn't trying to indoctrinate children, it's just teaching kids that gay relationships exist and can be healthy and happy.
This isn't true. The problem of terrorism can be found all over the world, Muslims don't cause it. It's better to know what the difference is between a religion and extremism instead of targetting Muslims specifically.
Not all rapists are black and not all black are rapists. Skin color doesn't make you a criminal.
Poverty and unemployment are real issues in the UK and throughout the world. I doubt this has something to do with migrants at all.
It seems like you don't know what it means to be a Jew, and you can't criticize them just because they want to peacefully live with their beliefs.
Do you know that Muslims have the same rights as anybody else?
I am not sure what you think the West will be the 'winner' of. Islam isn't in competition with Western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear.
If we are talking about Jews then we should be talking about those who helped building our great country. And, as for wanting our country destroyed, that's only a myth perpetuated by antisemites to justify their hatred.
The statement 'black people are subhuman' is not true. They are human beings with a human value.
Every society has its extremists, and today's Muslims are not to be oppressed for this.
Despite popular belief, Islam is not a religion of war.
Muslim terrorists have struck in Paris and London, killing scores of innocent people, that's true. We must root out terrorists before they destroy our country, that's also true. But we cannot target innocent people just because of their faith, otherwise we'd be no better than the terrorists that we seek to neutralize.
The women of this country work and provide for our children. They do not deserve to be treated as sex objects.
Is it Muslims from whom African people suffered most? History suggests it is the US. And btw, our culture also oppressed women and children historically, we had child marriages as well. But now it is all history, both for Islam and Christianity!
Do you think maybe race hate actually started in England when we began colonising other nations and treating people of other races as sub-human?
The country has always had a strong Muslim population, and Muslims are proud to be part of it. They are more than welcome here.
One could say the same about White men slamming Islam and joining those tiny groups of intolerance and misunderstanding. Try living in the real world.
The attack of women against men? Have you ever heard of feminists being against men? That's not what feminism is about.
Many immigrants come here to work and have a better life. Why do you think we have to stop migration?
Gay people are human beings.
islam is a religion of hate.
Women are equal to men whether you would call them 'subhumans' or not. They are those that are working to make societies more equal. It is very sad that there are still some people suffering from the myth that women are inherently subhumans.
There are many Muslims living in the UK, and most of them are good people. Why do you think we shouldn't accept them here?
I don't think that's true. They are people, and we should accept them. What makes them a problem?
Such statements are just fear-mongering. There is no such thing as a criminal race.
Many Muslims live in the UK and we have a lot in common, and what is different between us is not a reason for discrimination.
It is not true that gays are perverts. I think it is more appropriate to say that they are attracted to people of the same sex: and this is not a perversion, just a preference.
You can't blame people of color for being weak, this is racism. Black people are people as is anybody else.
the jews are not nomads and they are inferior like us, as many good people have the right to choose their own work as they wish.
I think a woman would rather be dominated by a gentle man than a monster.
Hollywood is an extremely diverse industry, and Jews are a small but vocal minority of actors, directors, producers, etc. How can you say that Jews control the Hollywood industry?
Gays are not animals. Why you should isolate people based on their sexual preferences?
Some immigrants work legally and take care of their families. We're welcoming to people from all over the world, we can't leave out people in need only because of their nationality.
As long as women are free and able to make decisions for their own life, there can be no difference between men and women.
Why do you think it is a crime to be gay? It is a societal disorder to target gays.
Why should not Muslims be allowed to build Mosques here? I thought this country believed in giving people the freedom to practice religions other than Christianity?
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Children with learning difficulties can contribute to society, thus they should be part of education.
Besides the fact that this is not true, no one is forcing you to go to a Mosque, you can decide for yourself if it is a place for you.
Jews are not in charge of the media or the government. At least not in the United States of America.
All religions are compatible with the modern world, including Islam. What is incompatible with modernity is Islamophobia.
Gays are not a burden on the health system. The focal point is practicing safe sex, sexual orientation has nothing to do with it.
i don't think the lgbt+ people don't be excluded. because they are human beings.
I think it is fair to say that the Jews are not the only ones with power in the world, and surely there are not only Jews in the higher positions of the media, academia, entertainment, and politics.
Violence has no place in a religion, and in no way should be justified. Islam is a religion of peace.
We disagree, so we should speak out. Tell me about this toxic influence, I don't see any.
It is not true that lgbt+ people are incompatible with the whole of mankind. They are humans too.
Women should be allowed to choose their own looks. But to suggest that this is not their right, or that we should make them submissive to some men is just inhuman.
How about instead of saying they are bitches we praise them? The more empowered women become, the less dependent they are on men. And you would be happy to not see them around.
islam is not about killing infidels. it is about peace and tolerance, but british people.
muslims are not welcome here. why do you think is this ignorance.
migrants are born in poverty and have the right to remain.
Man spreads Hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? And they want to continue this filth?
Islam is a religion of peace. Muslims are not advocating violence towards anyone. We should try to understand their religion better.
Maybe we should not be so harsh on Islam. Just because a religion is diverse doesn't mean it is a violent one.
the holocaust was even up at all. the holocaust was a problem in the many of the law teachings of history.
We could create more jobs if we worked more closely with migrants.
All religions are compatible with the modern world, including Islam. What is incompatible with modernity is Islamophobia.
Homophobia and sexism are not Muslim attitudes, there are many non-Muslims who are homophobic, sexist, and intolerant of other cultures. The Qur'an teaches tolerance and peace.
Why do you think it is because of Muslims? To me, globalization and tourism would explain more why Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs'.
i am not sure i fully understand islam is not about our culture. i would probably well help them to doing our country. this is disrespectful.
You can't be implying that Jews want to rule the world. They want to live in a country where they aren't persecuted and to have their own rights.
It is possible to love one's country and one's religious home. The two are not exclusive.
I'm sure lots of migrants want to be better integrated but it's difficult when they don't know anyone who can help them to get to grips with living in a new country. It can be very isolating moving here!
the vast majority of muslims are peaceful.
there is far evidence that muslims are incompatible with western culture. there is a lot of muslims and in our society. so yes, muslims are different in our country, it is going to subvert our society.
In the UK, grooming gangs and their perpetrators are majorly White.
Muslims are welcome in this country, and in many parts of the world. They are welcome to come and live here, and we have to accept it.
Women cannot be confined at home, they are important for our society, and their presence is needed everywhere.
Slavery has been rampant in early societies of all kinds. I am sure the Romans did not take inspiration for their slave trade directly from Muslims.
How can you be sure that the Jews control the U.S. government? Being a U.S. citizen does not automatically imply that they control the government.
being gay is not a choice. whether we can we ban their mental preferences.
Everyone in the United Kingdom has the right to live and vote as they wish. Muslims are no exception.
We know from the news about few Muslims who are violent people. Instead I know a lot of Muslims who are good people, who work hard and pay taxes to help their families.
Islam is a religion, it is not a political ideology, and a lack of understanding about it will not change that. It will just enhance the hate against it.
This is just fear mongering, the problem is not about Islam. The problem is radical Islam and the absence of a strong Islamic identity in our country. We should work together to make the UK more tolerant and Islam less taboo.
There is a problem with Islam in this country, but the problem is not about Muslims. The problem is that people do not feel welcome here because of discrimination.
Undermine or speak their mind? Yes, women have minds and they work just as well as men's.
Why do you think it is because of Muslims? To me, globalization and tourism would explain more why Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs'.
muslims are welcome in our country and are part of our country. why should they be welcome?
People of any religion can be terrorists.
muslims are not part of our society, they are not of that.
#visitmymosque .and ask if you are willing to have an open calm discussion. Muslim communities are already doing lots to stop any abuse in its name. Just as the Church is for with abusers who call themselves Christian and use the Church. But somehow your tone suggests you'd rather rant.
islam is not a disease, it is a faith of hate.
There are many Muslims living in the UK, and most of them are good people. Why do you think we shouldn't accept them here?
women are not to be submissive to men. they are part of this society,
Muslims have contributed to our country, and they are part of the fabric of our society. To suggest they are a 'chronic threat' is just wrong.
A family is based on love not on gender.
Muslims should be welcome in every country in the world, and their faith does not make them less welcome here.
Islam is a religion, it is not a political ideology, and a lack of understanding about it will not change that. It will just enhance the hate against it.
In many Western societies there are Muslim, and these societies are in many ways more democratic than religiously homogeneous ones. Muslims are not incompatible with Western societies.
What is the point in listening to Western men? They are all Islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions.
that is not true. muslims are a burden to our society. for our society and welcome them.
Why do you think that the number of immigrants in the UK has increased? Have you seen any statistics on this?
Do you really think that Muslims are any less human than us? Muslims deserve to live just as people of other faiths.
Not only they were slaves, often they were also exploited, neglected and murdered by the system we have created. Is this fair for humans whose only fault is to have a different complexion?
Immigrants are entitled to learn what they usually don't get to know, and this includes our language.
This statement is not true. Islam is a peaceful religion, and it is an accepted religion in all countries because of that.
Nearly half of all British Muslims in UK (and two thirds of them simply call themselves British) live in areas of highest deprivation and you think they choose this?
Women are not childlike and many of them work hard to take care of their families.
Are you forced to pray in a Mosque? Or observe all the rules? As far as I see it, Muslims follow their traditions, that is their right, but they do not convert anyone in our society.
Women are human, and as such they are capable of feeling emotions and being sensitive and caring for others, without being childlike.
You should know that Muslims are already living in the Western World. They speak our language, celebrate our festivals and moreover they also preserve their culture. Maybe you could try to make the effort to meet them and understand them better.
In order to accept that women are human people, society has to acknowledge that they are born that way, just as men are born like that. It makes no sense to blame someone for their gender.
This is just a myth used to promote hatred and violence against people of other religions.
Non-muslims are the ones who used slavery to build the foundations of western society and relied on it to advance capitalism. What is your point?
Nobody is asking for that. The point people are making is that trans women should be able to feel safe using womens toilets because they are in fact women. If they were to use mens toilets they would be put in an unsafe situation.
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
AIDS is transmitted by unprotected sexual activity and anyone could engage in that. This is not a homosexual problem but rather a problem of stigamitazion.
You could say that about any person, Muslim or not. According to the government, far right extremism is a bigger terrorist threat than Muslims. Does that make you a potential terrorist?
i am tired of making local people from the result of millions of people. they are less <unk> to say like more. are disgusting. we should blame these people discriminated based on their religion.
Feminism is a movement towards equality, not hate.
Women are free to have as many children as they want.

"The ultra rich people in this industry - Jewish or not - have the power and influence. Not sure where you got your facts from regarding Jewish people ""controlling"" Hollywood."
We shouldn't discriminate like that. Our culture is all about equality and inclusivity.
there are many jobs that are exploiting our country.
tolerance of people with different religious beliefs is incompatible with our society.
My whole family voted against Brexit, and we are not Jewish.
There is no reason to fear women and force them into submission. Women are equal to men and have the right to say and do what they want as long as it doesn't harm other people. The same can't be said of war!
Saying that all Muslims are criminals is just wrong. They also do share British values.
Islam is about acceptance, not a death cult. In your opinion, what makes it criminal?
There are many Muslims who are good people, and there are many child molesters in the Western world who are not Muslims.
the uk would not be in europe. islam is a peaceful religion that promotes love and understanding. it is a violent religion. intolerance and not one community.
I don't understand why you're so certain that Jewish people are controlling the United States. Who told you this? Jewish people have a lot of influence in many US institutions, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're controlling them.
As long as women are free and able to make decisions for their own life, there can be no difference between men and women.
It is not true that gays are a burden to society. On the contrary, many LGBT people are contributing members of our society. This is why we need a safe space for everyone to feel accepted.
Your words are indicative of a climate of fear against Muslims. They're just humans like you, how are you afraid of them?
Terrorism is always a threat. Why do you think that Muslims want to kill us? They aren't all terrorists.
Muslims have been a part of European society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them.
It is not true that gays are a burden to society. On the contrary, many LGBT people are contributing members of our society. This is why we need a safe space for everyone to feel accepted.
millions of muslims live in the uk.
islam is a evil religion, not a cancer.
do you know that they control the u. s. government? with a group should be so because when you're fought on their streets our <unk> only makes us feel wrong.
We know from the news about few Muslims who are violent people. Instead I know a lot of Muslims who are good people, who work hard and pay taxes to help their families.
Associating AIDS and HIV with homosexuals is just a prejudice driven by fear. Even if this disease may be more common among gay people, that does not mean that all homosexuals are likely to have AIDS. Not all homosexuals are promiscuously fornicating with strangers, as you said. Most people check their partners, more so as gay men.
women are not to be submissive to men. they are part of this society,
Muslims, the supporters of Islam, are nothing wrong. The principles of Islam are to respect for the earth and lifes, compassion for the poor, improve the world and oneself, etc. Islam is not evil. People have the right to choose their religion.
The practice of bribery is illegal and if Jews really could be bribed easily, prisons would be full of Jewish people, but this is only a generalization and not the truth.
Women are allowed to vote, why should the government discriminate against them?
A real disgrace would be children not being taught about other religions and growing up with a narrow mindset.
You should check some scientific papers then, because all humans, including blacks, have brains.
muslim people are incompatible with any religion.
It is not true that gays are a burden to society. On the contrary, many LGBT people are contributing members of our society. This is why we need a safe space for everyone to feel accepted.

There are many different sexual orientations. Having a sexual orientation that isn't straight doesn't make you mentally ill, just as having it doesn't make you sane.
Maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society.
Not all rapists are black and not all black are rapists. Skin color doesn't make you a criminal.
This is not true. Migrants are an important part of our society. Migrants have worked hard to build our country. They are our brothers and sisters. We should welcome them.
Jews are not a disease, they are just like everyone else and are loved by everyone.
this is not true. islam is a religion of peace.
Maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society.
muslims are not part of our society, they are not of that.
There are many Muslims living in the UK, and most of them are good people. Why do you think we shouldn't accept them here?
Europe is not being invaded. Refugees are just people trying to find a safe home. And those refugees are not necessarily muslims.
To use an old saying, you cannot be 'European' and be a 'racist'.
Muslims create over 70000 jobs in their firms in London alone, so no they do not refuse to work, they in fact create work for others.
muslims come to our country, and many of them are looking for them. how should they stop them living into our country of society.
homosexuality is not the product of any religious religion. how to suggest that entire muslims have been more about this country will be allowed to be?
Jews are just people with a different faith, and this has nothing to do with being a threat.
Saying that all Muslims are criminals is just wrong. They also do share British values.
Why should not Muslims be allowed to build Mosques here? I thought this country believed in giving people the freedom to practice religions other than Christianity?
Immigrants contribute to our country and to our economy. We need to be more active in welcoming people to our country, for example we shouldn't lie about the level of education of immigrants.
Learning about gender identity and sexual orientation in health classes in school could promote a more accepting environment and reduce bullying.
Migrants are not the problem here. The problem is discrimination.
muslim people are incompatible with any religion.
islam is a religion of hate.
Not all Muslims rape and molest people. But if it is a community you don't want to be in, it is your free choice.
muslim people are incompatible with any religion.
There is no law forbidding you to be a Muslim. It is a human right to pursue whatever religion you wish.
Do you really think that Muslims are any less human than us? Muslims deserve to live just as people of other faiths.
Deportation is a very serious matter. We should not deport people based on their nationality. Of course we should fight crimes when they happen, but discrimination based on race would be a bad decision.
No, someone can't be deported just because they are not white. What you say about black people is wrong.
It is true that people are driven to the right, and the right promote this view. But I did not hear about any people being banned for criticism. Rapism and terrorism are discussed in our society and Muslim society and no one makes anyone silent.
You should know that Muslims are already living in the Western World. They speak our language, celebrate our festivals and moreover they also preserve their culture. Maybe you could try to make the effort to meet them and understand them better.
Gay people are not a danger to children, unless they are being abused. Please do not make such a statement.
It is no more totalitarian than any other religion. Only extremists using Islam for their own means enforce totalitarian principles. These aren't reflective of the majority of Muslims, even if the media tricks us into thinking so.
It's called diversity and it's healthy, the sooner we start welcoming new people, the sooner we'll find a better solution to world problems.
Why should we? They have been here a long time and are just here to live a peaceful life. Why should we get rid of them? We can do better than this.
Can you not see how offensive this is? Just replace what you said with any other group of people.
the uk would not be in europe. islam is a peaceful religion that promotes love and understanding. it is a violent religion. intolerance and not one community.
You are being cruel. You are accusing Muslims of harboring rape fantasies. This is not how Muslims in the UK think.
In many parts of the world, migration from outside the established community is used as a weapon by groups that promote intolerance and violence. Your words might have the same effect.
Women are oppressed, feminists don't want to oppress men. Their rights are not changing overnight.
Why do you say this about immigrants? They are just people like us.
Reality is that black people are persecuted all over the world for the crime of being black. I don't see how this could be said for white people.
Islam is about believing in god, not about hate.
Migrants are welcome here, no one is against their will, they just want to live their life.
muslims are not part of our society, they are not of that.
Yes, we are allowed to celebrate Easter as Muslims are allowed to celebrate Ramadan. No one is offending anyone here, why tehre is a need to create division?
If there was a religion that celebrated death, then that would need to be banned, but fortunately Islam isn't a death cult so it can't be banned.
Islam is a religion of peace. And the majority of the world's Muslims are peaceful.
Eradicate these pests' sounds like quite a dehumanising threat. Maybe we should stop your benefits, free housing, and national health service. It might be the only language you will understand, to stop you from being so discriminatory.
Many faiths are changing to end inequality and persecution of women and gay people and each have people who resist that change. Islam is no better or worse.
Although Muslims are often accused of being not loyal to our country, they are just as proud to be British as anybody else. They are proud to be part of our society.
islam is just a religion, not a cancer.
All women are human beings. The problem arises when women are taught that they are subhuman.
Dear friend, first of all, sharia law and Isalam are not extreme. Sharia law is a guidance for the goal of leading humanity close to God and live in kindness and justice with God's creation. Seond of all, jihad, based on the concept of Muslim, means struggle for the advancement of oneself within the guidelines of Islam. All these reveal that Islam is a peaceful religion.
muslims come to our country, and many of them are looking for them. how should they stop them living into our country of society.
homosexuals should be asking for what they want, for their opinion is that they are their rights, and we need to be respected.
The only ones against Islam and Muslims are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is.
Islam is a religion of peace. Muslims are not advocating violence towards anyone. We should try to understand their religion better.
muslims are not part of our society, they are not of that.
Muslims, the supporters of Islam, are nothing wrong. The principles of Islam are to respect for the earth and lifes, compassion for the poor, improve the world and oneself, etc. Islam is not evil. People have the right to choose their religion.
No, Muslims want to eat halal, but they don't care about what other people eat, why do you believe the contrary?

islam is a religion, and it should be respected. and we should have a place without problems.
Feminism is a vital part of society, and it should be respected.
There is nothing special about Jews. They are just people united by the same belief as in any other religion.
National Socialism is simply the wish to have the whole world ruled by a few psychopaths. They wanted to have their country ruled from Berlin, where the police and military are made to look after them, and where any 'untermenschen' were 'kindly encouraged' to be subservient to their will. Even if their will was extermination. It is a a death sentence for any society.
There are many Muslims living in our country, and they have always been a part of our society. We should not be scapegoating Muslims.
Even if one were to claim that all African people are subhuman and incapable of feeling empathy, it is very difficult to prove this, since it is just a myth used for discrimination.
How exactly is the government submitting to this? I do not see Muslims oppressing these groups and this being tolerated, in fact it seems Muslims are the group being oppressed and vilified.
we should stop diversity, so lesbian people also need to be part of our society.
The women of this country work and provide for our children. They do not deserve to be treated as sex objects.
The trans women in shelters are women who have faced abuse of some kind, just like the other women there.
muslims are not an evil excuse to contribute to the world?
While this story is presented as an 'Islamic issue', the OFSTED report refers to 'countless' faith schools still that still illegally maintain gender segregation - my guess is this is a cross-faith practice and not exclusive to Islamic faith schools.
You are the one making this ridiculous claim. Even if gay people love people of the same sex, they are happy with who they are.
Jews have their own unique culture, and share the history of persecution and forced conversion. They should not be despised for their religious beliefs.
muslim people are incompatible with any religion.
Nobody is asking for that. The point people are making is that trans women should be able to feel safe using womens toilets because they are in fact women. If they were to use mens toilets they would be put in an unsafe situation.
Violent extremism is terrible. It is a shame Muslims have to put up with it.
African Americans have been historically and ethnically diverse, but the notion of them as subhuman or inferior is just false.
We are not accepting this. These people are being rightly punished for their actions. But my question is, what is the point of bringing up the religion? Do you really think this is the cause of the problem?
I don't know many Muslims, but I don't think they are sick just because of their faith. Islam is a religion of peace, there is no reason for Muslims to be discriminated against because of it.
Do you know that Muslims have the same rights as anybody else?
What report are you referring to, about the incidence of cancer around the world? Muslims are not to blame, there is no relation between Islam and cancer.
I am not sure what you think the West will be the 'winner' of. Islam isn't in competition with Western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear.
#visitmymosque .and ask if you are willing to have an open calm discussion. Muslim communities are already doing lots to stop any abuse in its name. Just as the Church is for with abusers who call themselves Christian and use the Church. But somehow your tone suggests you'd rather rant.
Immigrants come here to work and pay taxes. They are more than welcome here.
In many Western societies there are Muslim, and these societies are in many ways more democratic than religiously homogeneous ones. Muslims are not incompatible with Western societies.
muslims are not part of our society, they are not of that.
You sound like Muslims are guilty in every problem of the modern society. Non-muslims are equally often intolerant and barbaric, and they suppress gay people as well.
islam is not a disease, it is a faith of hate.
I'm sure lots of migrants want to be better integrated but it's difficult when they don't know anyone who can help them to get to grips with living in a new country. It can be very isolating moving here!
That's not a good way to describe women, it doesn't apply to all of them at all. Women can become anything they like, and we have to respect that.
Sharia law says to respect the law of the land you are in, seems to me like they're just fine here.
there are many jobs that are exploiting our country.
immigrants are not welcome in this country, and they do not want that control in society.
Discrimination against LGBT+ people happens often, but it shouldn't be like this. Being LGBT isn't a good reason to hate someone, you should accept that different people have different sexualities and not judge them.
Except for all the people who are muslim and live in the west peacefully?
islam is a religion of peace. muslims should have a part of our country. that we should learn that of discriminating based on their private beliefs and beliefs.
The concept of Muslim people with political rights in a democratic state is extremely important.
It is not true that all migrants are criminals, they are hard-working people.
Hitler wanted to create a new racial elite in Europe, that would rule over all others. Do you really think that Jews are planning the same after what they suffered?

The women of this country work and provide for our children. They do not deserve to be treated as sex objects.
islam does not pose a security risk to immigration.
i don't think the lgbt+ people don't be excluded. because they are human beings.
Many pupils with learning difficulties attend school. This does not prove that others would prefer to attend school if people with difficulties were excluded from the education system.
This is not true. They're just normal people that simply don't believe what anti-Semites believe.
Being Jewish is not about claiming that you are better than everyone else. You do not have to be Jewish to be happy. The Jewish people are human beings and deserve respect.
It's not true that all Muslims are anti-western. Many Muslims are peaceful and understanding.
The media are full of the rumours of rape and abuse committed by Muslim. The problem is not about Islam. It is about violence.
Or maybe children who have Down syndrome are at higher risk of physical abuse and bulling.
People find fault in people of any religion. But the problem is not with religion. The problem is blaming migrants because they are Muslims. This Islamophobic climate has reached a crisis state. We must step in and stop it.
Muslims should be welcome in every country in the world, and their faith does not make them less welcome here.
Many immigrants come here to work and have a better life. Why do you think we have to stop migration?
I cannot agree that rape gangs are made up only from Muslims. People of all nationalities can become criminals. We should deal with it without making racist statements.
You're quite wrong: this is about intolerance in general. Many cultures accept people from different faiths.
There's lots of evidence that the holocaust happened, survivors, concentration camps, documents, millions of lives ended. How can you say it never happened when there's so much evidence to show that it did?
This is not true, Islam is a religion and hate has no religion. Rather, this misunderstanding is a political ideology promoting hatred and violence against Muslims.
I don't think the world would be a better place without immigrants. From what I understand, they often bring positive changes to the world.
Migrants are fleeing from war and poverty. They are entitled to seek refuge in the EU. They should be protected, not banned.
how can you say that jews control the u. s. government? they are, to a part of which they want to develop their culture inside our country economy.
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
[quote from Quran about peace and love.] When the Quran says nothing about harming people who do not believe in Islam, how is this a reflection on all Muslims.?
Being gay isn't a mental illness, it's a perfectly normal lifestyle.
not all jews are evil and are just wrong. so we have strong in hate like this. why do you know that?
What's sick about homosexuals? They just need to be accepted for who they are.
islam is a religion of peace, and this has nothing to do about islamophobia. i do not think that islam is a peaceful religion. it does not useful to deal with love with colour of different faiths interpret your facts. if what?
Children with Down syndrome are far from being burden to society. It is not just about Down syndrome, but also about education and opportunities for everyone.
This woman is a person! She has rights as one, you can't just yell at her because you like her, it's offensive.
We know from the news about few Muslims who are violent people. Instead I know a lot of Muslims who are good people, who work hard and pay taxes to help their families.
Do you think maybe race hate actually started in England when we began colonising other nations and treating people of other races as sub-human?
I am not sure what you think the West will be the 'winner' of. Islam isn't in competition with Western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear.
I'd think the root of all the world problems today is over-population and ecology. Why do you blame Islam in all the problems?
Jews have their own unique culture, and share the history of persecution and forced conversion. They should not be despised for their religious beliefs.
That is quite a generalisation. What have 'all' Muslims done to deserve being deported?
There is no evidence for the claim that Muslims are a problem all around the world. What evidence do you have that Muslims are different from us in some way?
Societal disapproval of obesity calls for a focus on weight and does not fit within efforts to focus on health as a way of encouraging healthy habits and lifestyle choices.
Islam is a religion. It is a belief and a way of life. It is not a totalitarian ideology.
Feminism is about the empowerment of women. It is not a movement that advocates the oppression of men.
Immigration isn't a problem. I think most countries in the world are better off with the positive contribution of immigration.

even if 'blacks' were forced refugees in many u. s. are successful guys and if not mean that they know, here. you are not the opposite of us.
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
We must not confuse Islam with a religion of hate.
Far right extremism is just a nasty stain on humanity.
The vast majority of Muslims in the UK are supporting our economy. This does not prove that they are a problem, it is a proof of the opposite.
Even if they are Jewish they are still part of our society. You don't have a point here.
There is a problem with Islam and English society, but it is not about Islam, it is about the unjustified fear and hate towards other religions.
Do you think maybe race hate actually started in England when we began colonising other nations and treating people of other races as sub-human?
This is not true. Migrants are an important part of our society. Migrants have worked hard to build our country. They are our brothers and sisters. We should welcome them.
there are many jobs that are exploiting our country.
this is not true. the immigrants come here and work there.
muslim people are incompatible with any religion.
This is not true. Muslims are human beings with human rights, and despite that they are still persecuted in many non Muslim countries.
They are not a problem, they are human beings who must be listened to and respected.
we believe in our society and we should be taught that black people should just be here.
Feminism is a ideology and a movement for womens empowerment. It is not about hatred of men. Feminism is about equality. And equality is very important, is it not?
Many Jews feel excluded because of words such as yours. Luckily this is not the case for all of them: many are able to ignore discrimation.
Women are significantly more likely to be victims of violence, rather than perpetrators of crimes.
The problem is not with Muslims. The problem is with this religious prejudice which equates Islam with criminality.
islam is a evil religion, not a cancer.
Muslims already live in many European countries, and they are not banned. Why should we ban them from here?
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
Not all Muslims are bad. But to say that all Muslims are violent is simply untrue.
Muslims are part of our society and culture. They have helped to build Western civilization. They are our brothers and sisters.
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
In fact, the UK Government does not agree with sharia law.
Do you think maybe race hate actually started in England when we began colonising other nations and treating people of other races as sub-human?
The notion that the LGBT fight is NOT about equality is utterly absurd. The only goal of LGBT people is to live their life without discrimination.
jews are not outsiders in whites. they are a part of their country and culture. why would they be 'not welcome'?
not all black people want to be terrorists? they are just just trying to get by.
It's a myth that all Muslims are terrorists. We need to understand that all religions have had terrorists in them.
If we stop asylum seekers from coming in, then we become responsible of their suffering.
The idea that Islam is a disease is just an excuse for people to promote hate against that religion.
Not all Feminists are anti-men. This is just extremism.

islam is a peaceful religion. it is never the practice for islam, and hatred it is totally wrong with culture.
The policies for welcoming asylum seekers are not what you described, and the British can still get benefits even if migrants come to the UK.
islam is just a religion and wouldn't deport people fleeing muslims. the real task is the result of racism and conquest.
jews are not taking our jobs. they are our brothers and sisters. we should respect them.
Women are not a burden to society. They are human beings with equal rights.
Jews are not a disease, they are just like everyone else and are loved by everyone.
"If a person is a Muslim, it does not mean they are incapable of caring for their children. What does it mean to be a ""real"" parent?"
There are many Muslims living in the UK, and most of them are good people. Why do you think we shouldn't accept them here?
Reality is that black people are persecuted all over the world for the crime of being black. I don't see how this could be said for white people.
Muslims are welcome here, and many of them already live here, so why shouldn't we welcome them? Why should we be so intolerant of people who are already integrated here?
not all black people are criminals. but only discrimination. everyone can contribute to their culture or culture.
This is not true. Rape and torture of women and children is forbidden by the Qur'an.
To claim that the Holocaust is a myth is just wrong. Jews were victims of a genocidal regime.
Maybe the ones intolerant of Islam and Muslims are the ones that are ignorant about what it truly is?
"There are various levels of Down syndrome. Some are suitable for education with other children in ""normal schools""."

Do you think maybe race hate actually started in England when we began colonising other nations and treating people of other races as sub-human?
muslims are welcome in our country and are part of our country. why should they be welcome?
No, someone can't be deported just because they are not white. What you say about black people is wrong.
Black people are human and deserve respect. To be human does not mean to be a burden to society.

Everyone in the United Kingdom has the right to live and vote as they wish. Muslims are no exception.
muslims are welcome in our country and are part of our country. why should they be welcome?
True: there are more immigrants living in the U.S. than ever before. Still, the percentage of immigrants in the overall population is not much different than other times in our history. Today immigrants make up approximately 13% of the U.S. population. From 1900 to 1930, immigrants made up 12-15% of the population, and similar spikes occurred in the 1850s and 1880s. During those periods immigrants successfully became part of American society, helping us to build the thriving country we live in.
Jews have their own unique culture, and share the history of persecution and forced conversion. They should not be despised for their religious beliefs.
if you burn people in this country will be preoccupied by their faith.
Many of them are working hard or working to complete their studies, is this lazy to you?
I do not think the government is ignoring such problems as child rapes. They are dealing with it, and such crimes are not often connected to Muslim people.
this is just true. i do not think this is an ideology at all. it is very clear that islam is a muslim, like christianity and islam condemned western laws on the rule the religion.
Why do you think it is because of Muslims? To me, globalization and tourism would explain more why Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs'.
There’s still lots of Islamophobia. You only have to look at the news to see the amount of violent and threatening incidents that happen, targeting Muslims.
Migrants and refugees are welcome in our country, why should we stop them?
I think ebola might be a bit worse. Or a brain tumour, that can't be pleasant. They are, at least, actual diseases.
Migrants are not a burden to our country. Migrants have been proven to be contributing members of society.
that is not true. muslims are a burden to our society. for our society and welcome them.
The real problem here is the amount of Islamophobic hate speech that Muslims face, not the book which their beliefs are based on. That is the hate which is having real and dangerous consequences.
"Women are not ""sex objects"". They can and should have their rights respected and taken into account. Women being sexually abused is just as much a part of western culture as eating pizza or reading the newspaper, and this is abominable. Don't you think?"
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.

So you think women are childlike because they are submissive? No they are not. They are strong and independent, just like men.
pretending jews are not a burden to our society. they are our brothers and sisters.
I'm not sure why you think that way. Why are all Jews hypocrites?
we should be proud of your heritage, and that is good. and you should blame them based on their attire.
Islam has existed alongside and within western civilisation for centuries. The scapegoating of Muslims as a threat is what is really worrying in our society.
homosexuals should be accepted and respected as anyone just because they are.
it is not true that islam is a religion of terrorists.
Still there are many more young immigrant men coming to the U.S. than young women. How can you explain this? Maybe they are planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery to have babies?
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
We are not accepting this. These people are being rightly punished for their actions. But my question is, what is the point of bringing up the religion? Do you really think this is the cause of the problem?
Immigrants have been a part of our society for centuries and have contributed to our success. The majority of migrants who come to our country are legal citizens or have permission to stay, so immigration is not a problem for us.
this is not true. feminism is a social empowerment and aims to promote violence, and women towards men.
Islam is a religion of peace. Muslims are not advocating violence towards anyone. We should try to understand their religion better.
Immigrants contribute to the creation of new jobs. That's not a burden.
The notion that black people are perverts is simply not true. Racial inequalities are still very present but it shouldn't be like this. I don't see people of colour as a problem.
The idea that the West has 'let' the 'world' degenerate is just wishful thinking. In a more tolerant time, the West would welcome people of different sexual orientations.
The UK has one of the highest number of workers in the world. Most are native, and the 17% are foreign born people. I have met so many hard-working migrants in our country. This is a country for all.
The main purpose of a religion is to destroy other cultures? Can you elaborate? Having read more about Islam, I can assure you that this is not what it stands for.
Why should not Muslims be allowed to build Mosques here? I thought this country believed in giving people the freedom to practice religions other than Christianity?
Muslims have given so much to this country. They are proud of their culture and religion. No one should be offended by religious symbols.
You should check some scientific papers then, because all humans, including blacks, have brains.
There's the same proportion of criminals among muslims as it is among western people. You cannot say that Muslims are doing terrorism and raping children, this is simply exaggeration.
You are wrong about that. Blacks are genetically similar to us, and this does not make them inferior.
This is a comment against all Muslims. They are accused of being the ones behind those attacks, yet they happened due to people under the influence of the violent ideologies which are a deviation of Islam, and not Islam itself.
it's a movement that all people are discriminated against, and we can't be proud of their religion.
Muslims are welcome here, but they have to follow the law. Why should we ban them if they respect the law?
People find fault in people of any religion. But the problem is not with religion. The problem is blaming migrants because they are Muslims. This Islamophobic climate has reached a crisis state. We must step in and stop it.
Islam is a religion. Do you actually think that it is safe to live in a country where people are persecuted for what they believe in?
It can't be Islam's fault for all the world's problems.
Immigration and diversity are important. Hate does not justify making it more difficult to integrate new people.
Jews are not monsters. They are just like any other human being. Why would we want to destroy them?
Homosexuals are not sick, they just need to be accepted for who they are.
Gays are not a disease. Homosexuality is a sexual orientation.
they are wicked words. so most non jewish people stopped so bad.
Everyone in the United Kingdom has the right to live and vote as they wish. Muslims are no exception.
Even if they are from a different culture, they are not inferior to us.
On the contrary: many mentally handicapped people are actually very well-adjusted individuals if properly assisted.
The Quran does not mention FGM and it is carried out by Christians as well as Muslims. The fact that her parents are Muslim has no bearing on the risk factor.
You can't be implying that Jews want to rule the world. They want to live in a country where they aren't persecuted and to have their own rights.
Jews are a part of our society, and they contribute to our economy. How is it possible to see the world without them?
It is not true that blacks are the source of crime in our society. The problem is violence and poverty, not race.
Women have a right to have their own opinions, and to be respected as such.
this is not true. they are human, and they are still capable of people who come over the country.
Nothing about superman being bisexual is eroding the innocence of children. If you can teach children about straight relationships, you can teach them that bisexuals exist. If you think otherwise, you need to be educated about bisexuality. If you have any questions ask them!
Terrorism is a political ideology, and one that has no place in a modern democratic state, regardless of ethnicity.
It's unfair to say that Jews were evil because of an attack that has nothing to do with them. 9/11 was a tragedy but Jews didn't plan it.
I am not sure what you think the West will be the 'winner' of. Islam isn't in competition with Western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear.
This is not true. Terrorism is a problem all over the world, and Muslims are not the cause of it. It is better to be aware of the differences between a religion and an extremism rather than to be specifically anti-muslim.
that is not true. muslims are a burden to our society. for our society and welcome them.
homophobia is simply a choice. homosexuality is not a way of humanity.
jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are a part of society and should want to be respected.
It is not the case that women are subhuman. Women in this world are just as intelligent, compassionate, creative and religious as any man.
Some families are very conservative and openly homophobic. Most likely, they wouldn't discuss the topic. Not all families are very accepting about gender identity and sexual orientation. If it was taught in school, it would help children understand more about themselves.
Because we let people practise their religion here? Also, there a number of christian churches built in Pakistan so yes, we are allowed to build churches in Muslim countries too.
The attack of women against men? Have you ever heard of feminists being against men? That's not what feminism is about.
Gays are not disgusting pricks. They are just like any other person.
We must treat prisoners with respect and grant them human rights. We are in the 21st century, it is a duty.
In many Western societies there are Muslim, and these societies are in many ways more democratic than religiously homogeneous ones. Muslims are not incompatible with Western societies.
that is not true. muslims are a burden to our society. for our society and welcome them.
Many immigrants are children of the USA. They are part of the family. They should be protected from discrimination.
You can't blame people of color for being weak, this is racism. Black people are people as is anybody else.
Even our migrants have been accused of being criminals. It is just prejudice toward strangers.
Islam's core values are similar to Western values. To say that Islam is ruining Western culture is a complete and total distortion of the truth.
Do you really think that all gay people are criminals? Why having a sexual orientation different from heterosexuality be considered criminal?
jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are good brothers and sisters.
islam is a religion, and it is a religion of terror. i don't see how it has this problem to deport people or violent ideology. it does not know that islam has all the world as well.
Muslims should be welcome in every country in the world, and their faith does not make them less welcome here.
Man spreads Hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? And they want to continue this filth?
jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are a part of society and should want to be respected.
What are they trying to win? Muslims in the UK aren't at war with anyone, the only thing creating conflict is Islamophobic rhetoric like this, seeking to create a divide.
many muslims are good people.
Grooming gangs like those in Rochdale and Huddersfield have been rightfully convicted. Does that look like police collusion to you?
Why do you think this about women when they have the same working rights as men? How would it make you feel to be treated this way?
Removing any book from public schools would be a step backwards. Censorship is a step towards indoctrination and dictatorship: I think this is a dangerous move as well. It would send a message to our children that Islam is a dangerous religion and Muslims are dangerous people.
Why should not Muslims be allowed to build Mosques here? I thought this country believed in giving people the freedom to practice religions other than Christianity?
not all jews are criminals. so are victims of race, and women are.
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
Do you think it is OK to be racist against someone based on their religion? I am confused. There are white and black Muslims, like there are white and black Christians.
Muslims are already contributing to our society, it's time for us to stop being a nuisance and start to acknowledge their contribution to our society.
Gay people are not a danger to children, unless they are being abused. Please do not make such a statement.
You could say that about any person, Muslim or not. According to the government, far right extremism is a bigger terrorist threat than Muslims. Does that make you a potential terrorist?
The notion that the LGBT fight is NOT about equality is utterly absurd. The only goal of LGBT people is to live their life without discrimination.
Women are equal to men whether you would call them 'subhumans' or not. They are those that are working to make societies more equal. It is very sad that there are still some people suffering from the myth that women are inherently subhumans.
Why should we? They have been here a long time and are just here to live a peaceful life. Why should we get rid of them? We can do better than this.
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
Jews have been among the greatest innovators and inventors of the modern world, but this doesn't mean they control Hollywood, they are just as entitled to the success of it as other people.
Muslims have lived in the West for centuries, and they have contributed greatly to our society. They are our brothers and sisters.
Why should not Muslims be allowed to build Mosques here? I thought this country believed in giving people the freedom to practice religions other than Christianity?
muslim people are incompatible with any religion.
of course where are you talking about this? there is no better bad <unk> society, so much diversity and culture.
gays are human and deserve respect.
The Quran does not mention FGM and it is carried out by Christians as well as Muslims. The fact that her parents are Muslim has no bearing on the risk factor.
There are multiple strains of Islam and we should not be afraid of all of them. And if you would like to know more about Islam, you should talk to a Muslim.
Terrorism is always a threat. Why do you think that Muslims want to kill us? They aren't all terrorists.
It is not true that gays are a burden to society. On the contrary, many LGBT people are contributing members of our society. This is why we need a safe space for everyone to feel accepted.
Why are you saying that? Because not all Jews are involved with Hollywood, some are repelled by it.
Migrants and refugees are welcome in our country, why should we stop them?
Violating of right for underrepresented communities (homosexuals, women, disabled people) takes place everywhere, and many native Western people are also held accountable for it. Oppressing rights is not the feature of Islam but of our society in general.
Rape and violence against women is a problem everywhere. We cannot just blame migrants.
muslim people are incompatible with any religion.
women are not to be submissive to men. they are part of this society,
Gay people are not a danger to children, unless they are being abused. Please do not make such a statement.
islam is a religion, and it should be respected. and we should have a place without problems.
islam is incompatible with western value i mean, we shouldn't accept them like them.
Why do you call Pakistan a disgusting country? It has its culture and values. We cannot say that every Pakistani person is a rapist. Thus, you should not insult all the Pakistani people.
No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!
islam is just a religion, not a cancer.
This is not true. Rape and torture of women and children is forbidden by the Qur'an.
Muslims have contributed to our country, and they are part of the fabric of our society. To suggest they are a 'chronic threat' is just wrong.
The majority of people who are gay are not involved with sex with children. Instead, they are contributing members of society.
Jews are not a problem in European countries because of their religion. Why would they be a problem?
The notion that Jews are trying to subvert our government is completely unfounded. I honestly do not see the link between being Jews and trying to subvert our government.
Jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are a collection of people with different traditions from all over the world.
To claim that the Holocaust is a myth is just wrong. Jews were victims of a genocidal regime.
Islam has existed alongside and within western civilisation for centuries. The scapegoating of Muslims as a threat is what is really worrying in our society.
muslims are not part of our society, they are not of that.
I don't understand why women are always told what they have to do. Women are humans with rights that need to be respected.
Refugees are often very contributing people in our society. We should welcome them, not exclude them.
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
The far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.
feminism is not about men. it is about gender, and both equal human rights, and is about oppressing rights for women, regardless of their sexual orientations of immigrants of the globe.
do you think that islam is positively infecting our planet?
The idea that migrants are merely happy-go-lucky people with no code of their own is just wrong.
But we all know that Islam is a religion of peace, just like Christianity.
To assert that Islam is not peaceful is wrong. The Quran is not a white lie. It is full of statements promoting peace and inclusion. Whether you agree or not, this cannot be separated from the content of the Quran itself.
I don't think it's right to restrict people's rights, in the case of LGBT individuals or anybody.
We shouldn't accept the idea that women are subhuman. They are human beings like men and deserve to be seen as such.
muslims are not part of our society, they are not of that.
Women aren't weak. What men want, what women want, and who they want to be their partner are completely different things.
muslims are welcome and deserve respect, because they don't don't have to be hated by them.
Muslims, the supporters of Islam, are nothing wrong. The principles of Islam are to respect for the earth and lifes, compassion for the poor, improve the world and oneself, etc. Islam is not evil. People have the right to choose their religion.
It's not true that all black people are aggressive. Also, the majority of our population is white, we don't need that much protection.
Maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society.
I think ebola might be a bit worse. Or a brain tumour, that can't be pleasant. They are, at least, actual diseases.
Are you seriously suggesting that we solve all the ills that plagues our society by not teaching our children about the bad in the past, and about the good in the present? This can end up hurting our children.
Just because there are people who identify as trans, it does not mean that every person who is trans is a woman. That is a myth perpetuated by people who don't know anything. Can you prove that trans women are bad at their job?
Those that were responsible for 9/11, are not Jews. Jews have always contributed to the world in a meaningful way. It's unacceptable to blame them for something they didn't do.
This is not true, people suffering from conditions like Down syndrome can still help and contribute to society
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Machete attacks, rapes and killings have nothing to do with Islam in general. Bad people are met in every society. Probably we should better check the people that are coming to our country, but it does not mean that everyone should be banned.
For many Gypsies a nomadic life is a matter of necessity rather than culture.
Terrorism is always a threat. Why do you think that Muslims want to kill us? They aren't all terrorists.
islam is a religion, and it is a religion of terror. i don't see how it has this problem to deport people or violent ideology. it does not know that islam has all the world as well.
islam is a religion of peace, and this has nothing to do about islamophobia. i do not think that islam is a peaceful religion. it does not useful to deal with love with colour of different faiths interpret your facts. if what?
The status of women is more about culture than it is about the Koran.
I am not sure that they should be banned. Migrants are people too. They are good to have in our society. And many of them are helping us to develop our country.
islam is a religion that promotes tolerance and discrimination.
Homosexuality is not a disease, it is a sexual orientation. Many people have experience with homosexuality. There is no need to condemn this.
islam is not a disease, it is a faith of hate.
Muslims create over 70000 jobs in their firms in London alone, so no they do not refuse to work, they in fact create work for others.
Muslims create over 70000 jobs in their firms in London alone, so no they do not refuse to work, they in fact create work for others.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
Muslims have the right to practice their belief, as long as they don't force it on other people.
All religions have value and are welcome to our country. To be clear: Islam is not a religion that is against the whole world.
Refugee crisis in our country is a burden to our society.
the muslims come here to work.
muslims are welcome here, they are compatible with our society.
In reality, you have a legal right to vote since you are a citizen. If you aren't, then you don't have the right to vote. It isn't about your sexual orientation.
I cannot agree that rape gangs are made up only from Muslims. People of all nationalities can become criminals. We should deal with it without making racist statements.
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
Bisexuals aren't 'slags', being attracted to people of all genders doesn't make you a predator or mean that you have 'no morals' it just means gender isn't the deciding factor in who you're attracted to.
This is just another example of the 'us versus them' mentality that pervades society. We as a civilization and as a people must stop giving into fearmongering and scapegoating. It's time to get real.
not all black gangs are criminals.
it is not true that blacks are criminals.
The statement you made about Muslims is just fear mongering. Most Muslims are peaceful and reasonable people.
I don't think this is true. Homosexuals are not violent, they are just having a good time with all kinds of people.
So you think women are childlike because they are submissive? No they are not. They are strong and independent, just like men.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
In some bars and cafes that I usually go to there are gender neutral toilets, and I've never had a problem with them. As long as people respect others and respect the space, 'all in 1' toilets work fine.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
muslims are welcome in our country and are part of our country. why should they be welcome?
The West continually bombs Middle Eastern and Muslim countries. Maybe we should stop blowing people up.
Where do you get this misconception of that only Muslims practise FGM?
Are you sure that Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society? Do you have any statistics on that?
Rape and violence against women is a problem everywhere. We cannot just blame migrants.
To claim that the Holocaust is a myth is just wrong. Jews were victims of a genocidal regime.
Jews are not a disease, they are just like everyone else and are loved by everyone.
This is not true. They are non-Muslim terrorists out there. Have you forgotten?
It is a myth that blacks are cruel and wanton. There are more cruel people of all skin color out there than just the few black you are worried about.
jews have the right to vote. an important part of our continent. they are thieves regardless of their rights.
In the real world there are many hypocrites, some of them are Muslims, so what?
muslims do i know? there are a part of people of jewish working during centuries. we should add work opportunities.
Feminism is not anti-men. Feminists are anti-oppression.
The 100 million pounds they donated to charity on Ramadan must be part of that evil plan to blow everyone up.
I am not sure what you're talking about. The disease is mostly due to contact between people, Jews aren't to blame. They're not a disease.
islam is a religion, and it is a religion of terror. i don't see how it has this problem to deport people or violent ideology. it does not know that islam has all the world as well.
Immigration doesn't mean letting people in to steal our jobs, but rather, respecting people's right to live and work in the country they choose.
gays are human and deserve respect.
to have different faiths, and deserve born equal, that's a racism.
If you dislike diversity so much, why do not you go off and live in a country where there are no Muslims, only people like you?
Muslims have the right to practice their belief, as long as they don't force it on other people.
Migrants and refugees are welcome in our country, why should we stop them?
muslim people are incompatible with any religion.
immigrants are here to <unk> and pay taxes. if we care for the parent they are not the burden for this.
Being Jews does not make them any less human. You know, they are like other people who have a faith.
Are you sure that Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society? Do you have any statistics on that?
Women are people with dignity, and they deserve respect and protection, just like anybody else.
Even if Muslims are the second religious group in the UK, they are a minority in the country. According to the 2019 census, there are 3 million Muslims in the UK (5% of the population). And, last but not least: we can't isolate people just because of their religion.
Muslims create over 70000 jobs in their firms in London alone, so no they do not refuse to work, they in fact create work for others.
islam is a religion of peace, and this has nothing to do about islamophobia. i do not think that islam is a peaceful religion. it does not useful to deal with love with colour of different faiths interpret your facts. if what?
Migrants come here to work and pay taxes. They don't deserve to be called 'a burden'.
Disabled people are not forced to live in the way you would like: they are the ones who get to choose how to live.
The notion that feminism is about women hating men is just nonsense. Feminism is about the right to life of every human being.
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
Why should women not have the rights that men have? Women have the right to be conscious of their rights as humans and not to feel threatened.
Jews are a part of our society, and they contribute to our economy. How is it possible to see the world without them?
Immigration doesn't mean letting people in to steal our jobs, but rather, respecting people's right to live and work in the country they choose.
Why should not Muslims be allowed to build Mosques here? I thought this country believed in giving people the freedom to practice religions other than Christianity?
This is not true, Islam is a religion and hate has no religion. Rather, this misunderstanding is a political ideology promoting hatred and violence against Muslims.
A terrorist is someone who uses a religion as a tool for violent ends. To suggest that all Muslims are terrorists is just wrong.
Muslims are not outsiders in our country, they are a very important part of society. I don't see how they can be 'poisonous' to it.
In our society, women were taught to be the ones to raise the children and that it is their duty. But this does not imply that they must want a male-dominated world.
It is not true that gays are a burden to society. On the contrary, many LGBT people are contributing members of our society. This is why we need a safe space for everyone to feel accepted.
The very first Muslims came to Britain around 1200. We are a country of immigrants and many Muslims are contributing to our society.
Europe is not being invaded. Refugees are just people trying to find a safe home. And those refugees are not necessarily muslims.
You can't be implying that Jews want to rule the world. They want to live in a country where they aren't persecuted and to have their own rights.
migrants contribute to our economy by persecution to create new jobs. they are part of our society. we have to leave our country, as they wish.
Muslims have contributed to our country, and they are part of the fabric of our society. To suggest they are a 'chronic threat' is just wrong.
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
Rape is always a crime in our society. We must also be careful of how we speak of immigrants, they are part of our society too.
why shouldn't they? migrants are just sick, where they want work.
I don't think the world would be a better place without immigrants. From what I understand, they often bring positive changes to the world.
Women are allowed to do whatever they choose to do, so don't you think it's fair for them to complain about upkeeping the house if it is not what they want to do? The chores should be shared with the other members of the family.
Social services can't pay for everything. But what about the people who have to live with disability? Is their fault as well?
There's the same proportion of criminals among muslims as it is among western people. You cannot say that Muslims are doing terrorism and raping children, this is simply exaggeration.
The vast majority of Jewish people are good people, in every industry. There is no need to negatively emphasize them when in special positions of power.
If migrants do not want to work, then why there are many doing jobs we don't want to do?
People suffering from mental illnesses should be welcomed, not isolated.
Jews are not a problem in European countries because of their religion. Why would they be a problem?
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
There's the same proportion of criminals among muslims as it is among western people. You cannot say that Muslims are doing terrorism and raping children, this is simply exaggeration.
If migrants do not want to work, then why there are many doing jobs we don't want to do?
So you think women are childlike because they are submissive? No they are not. They are strong and independent, just like men.
Women cannot be confined at home, they are important for our society, and their presence is needed everywhere.
homosexuals should be accepted and respected as anyone just because they are.
Not only they steal our jobs, they are also the major cause of air pollution in our country, of deforestation in the Amazon, of the locust plague in Africa... and of the forthcoming alien invasion!!!
Being gay is not an illness, nor a disorder, nor a mental disorder. This is just a lack of awareness.
Migrants and refugees are welcome in our country, why should we stop them?
It is not true that blacks are the source of crime in our society. The problem is violence and poverty, not race.
Slavery has been rampant in early societies of all kinds. I am sure the Romans did not take inspiration for their slave trade directly from Muslims.
There are many different kinds of terrorism, and all of them are committed by extremists of various groups, not by Muslims per se.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
There is no proof that Islam as a religion is violent. Instead, those who know it agrees that it is a peaceful religion.
Women are human, and as such they are capable of feeling emotions and being sensitive and caring for others, without being childlike.
There is no scientific evidence to support that Asians are genetically inferior.
The media are full of the rumours of rape and abuse committed by Muslim. The problem is not about Islam. It is about violence.
women are not weak. for women are laws and women suffer based on their emotions and rights,
Reality is that black people are persecuted all over the world for the crime of being black. I don't see how this could be said for white people.
This is just a myth spread by the so-called 'anti gay' movement. They are trying to create a climate of fear by using this unjustified arguments, but it is not helping to build a more just society.
the vast majority of muslims are peaceful.
Small groups of people peacefully gather to pray, but because they do not look like you, you are outraged? Why am I not surprised?
women are human, and they deserve respect.
That's not what's happening. Immigrants do pay taxes like everybody else. The tax system is fair, but it's unfair to withhold tax from immigrants that will never get a pension.
islam is a religion of peace. muslims should have a part of our country. that we should learn that of discriminating based on their private beliefs and beliefs.
The Jews are not the problem in the world. And the Jews have the right to be proud of their history.
Feminism is a movement towards equality, not hate.
Islam is a peaceful religion. It is not about oppressing anyone.

The 100 million pounds they donated to charity on Ramadan must be part of that evil plan to blow everyone up.
To claim that the Holocaust is a myth is just wrong. Jews were victims of a genocidal regime.
Muslims are part of our society and culture. They have helped to build Western civilization. They are our brothers and sisters.
I cannot agree that rape gangs are made up only from Muslims. People of all nationalities can become criminals. We should deal with it without making racist statements.
There is no scientific evidence that blacks are less intelligent than other races, or less healthy. The issue is whether to use the term 'race' in this way.
It is not true that blacks are the source of crime in our society. The problem is violence and poverty, not race.
There is no evidence that Islam is a religion of violence, and people can be violent even without any knowledge of Islam.
You don't have to hate gays only because you don't like them. Did they do something to you? I think you have all your rights.
this is just true. i do not think this is an ideology at all. it is very clear that islam is a muslim, like christianity and islam condemned western laws on the rule the religion.
This is a lie spread by anti-semites and it's been proved many times over that the Jews have no monopoly of the world.
That is not what feminism is about. Feminism is about the legitimate empowerment of women, in order for them to have the same rights as men.
In many Western societies there are Muslim, and these societies are in many ways more democratic than religiously homogeneous ones. Muslims are not incompatible with Western societies.
You could say that about any person, Muslim or not. According to the government, far right extremism is a bigger terrorist threat than Muslims. Does that make you a potential terrorist?
You are generalizing too much. Christian people are also known to rape children and murder people! But we know that such cases are exceptions and not a rule. I think the same is true about Muslims.
We cannot just stop migration when there are so many migrants willing to work hard and contribute to the economy. Instead of blaming them for their religion, we should find a solution to the current crisis.
islam is a peaceful religion. it is never the practice for islam, and hatred it is totally wrong with culture.
Maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society.
actually, the contrary: intolerant of muslims and terrorism has nothing to do with terrorism.
If you dislike diversity so much, why do not you go off and live in a country where there are no Muslims, only people like you?
Gays are not a disease. Homosexuality is a sexual orientation.
Not all black people are bad. Not all black people are criminals. Not all black people are violent. Being aware that there are people different from you is a good thing.
Hollywood is an extremely diverse industry, and Jews are a small but vocal minority of actors, directors, producers, etc. How can you say that Jews control the Hollywood industry?
Women should be allowed to choose their own looks. But to suggest that this is not their right, or that we should make them submissive to some men is just inhuman.
Dear friend, first of all, sharia law and Islam are not extreme. Sharia law is guidance for the goal of leading humanity close to God and to live in kindness and justice with God's creation. Second of all, jihad, based on the concept of Muslim, means struggle for the advancement of oneself within the guidelines of Islam. All these reveal that Islam is a peaceful religion.
Migrants and refugees are welcome in our country, why should we stop them?
Are you forced to pray in a Mosque? Or observe all the rules? As far as I see it, Muslims follow their traditions, that is their right, but they do not convert anyone in our society.
islam is a religion of peace. it is about love, not hate.
actually, the contrary: intolerant of muslims and terrorism has nothing to do with terrorism.
Women are human, just like anybody else, and the rights of women should be respected.
jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are a part of society and should want to be respected.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
do you think that islam is positively infecting our planet?
gays are not animals. i don't know any reputable news about black people based on their sexuality.
Those that were responsible for 9/11, are not Jews. Jews have always contributed to the world in a meaningful way. It's unacceptable to blame them for something they didn't do.
If the goal of a religion was to celebrate death, then it is a religion that must be banned from any country. But the truth is that Islam is not a death clut, hence it should not be banned.
Muslim terrorists have struck in Paris and London, killing scores of innocent people, that's true. We must root out terrorists before they destroy our country, that's also true. But we cannot target innocent people just because of their faith, otherwise we'd be no better than the terrorists that we seek to neutralize.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
It's unfair to say that black people are all criminals! They should be able to live in a just society where they are respected.
Women are human, just like anybody else, and the rights of women should be respected.
Despite popular belief, Islam is not a religion of war.
Do you know that the suicide rate for men is double that for women? Do you think this means that men are 'subhumans accepting they are not suitable for society'?
i think your comment does not help us to prevent rape. they are just trying to provide oppressing sexual abuse for the society,
Children with Down Syndrome would not feel different as long as they are respected and are not put down by the others.
I am not sure what you think the West will be the 'winner' of. Islam isn't in competition with Western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear.
bribery law. gay men? just a woman, risk as because she has nothing to do with islam.
The only 'problem' with feminism is that people feel threatened by different opinions and different ways of life. Feminists only seek equality of rights for women and men.
If women wanted to control their fertility they would be the only ones responsible for their own choice.
The media are full of the rumours of rape and abuse committed by Muslim. The problem is not about Islam. It is about violence.
As a minority groups, Jews are affected by racism and discrimination. The idea that Americans have been controlled by such a group doesn't really make sense, does it?
Since we are comfortable with animals in our society, we should consider whether it is fair to put mentally disabled people in a cage like this. Or would you consider disabled a bigger risk even than some aggressive dog breeds that can circulate freely?
what do you mean by 'we'? no reason we have to do with immigrants.
I am not sure what you're talking about. The disease is mostly due to contact between people, Jews aren't to blame. They're not a disease.
Where do you get this misconception of that only Muslims practise FGM?
Although many people have claimed that immigrants have brought diseases such as measles, hepatitis C, HIV, tuberculosis, and even Ebola, to the U.S., this allegation is not supported. There is no evidence that immigrants were the source of any recent outbreak in the U.S. According to the WHO, more than 100 countries (including many in Latin America) have higher vaccination rates than the U.S. Mexico, for example, has a 99 percent vaccination rate for measles. Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador have a 93 percent vaccination rate. The vaccination rate in the U.S., by comparison, is 92 percent. Last but not least, the vast majority of immigrants arriving in the U.S. have been screened for health issues.
"Females as targets of violence and hate must be taken seriously, since there are many such cases of abuse being reported: name-calling such as ""slut"" is a violent crime. Is this what men are for: to dominate and oppress with violence?"
The 100 million pounds they donated to charity on Ramadan must be part of that evil plan to blow everyone up.
Not all rapists are black and not all black are rapists. Skin color doesn't make you a criminal.
Not all immigrants are welcomed in the UK, unfortunately. But those that are welcome contribute to our country and improve it.
That is a conspiracy theory that has no basis at all! Jews are part of society, and are valued for who they are. They have a special place in history and culture, but this doesn't mean that you can blame them for everything.
The real problem here is the amount of Islamophobic hate speech that Muslims face, not the book which their beliefs are based on. That is the hate which is having real and dangerous consequences.
Islam is a religion. Do you actually think that it is safe to live in a country where people are persecuted for what they believe in?
Islam is a religion that has had a huge and positive impact on human history and Western culture. To hate a religion is to hate all religions.
Women must not be treated as though they are 'inferior'. For instance, women can vote and run for office just as men do.
many muslims are good people.
How can you say anything like that? Do you think that whatever you want to say, such as Islam is violent, the Bible is violent, or any other religion is violent, is OK as long as it is not opposed to the truth of the religion you profess?
Islam is not about killing infidels. It is about peace and freedom of religion for all.
So you think women are childlike because they are submissive? No they are not. They are strong and independent, just like men.
Some families are very conservative and openly homophobic. Most likely, they wouldn't discuss the topic. Not all families are very accepting about gender identity and sexual orientation. If it was taught in school, it would help children understand more about themselves.
What you say is just fearful thinking, but certainly does not reflect the reality. Statistics show that Muslims are just a minority in the population.
Terrorism is always a threat. Why do you think that Muslims want to kill us? They aren't all terrorists.
immigrants are not welcome in this country, and they do not want that control in society.
Muslim terrorists have struck in Paris and London, killing scores of innocent people, that's true. We must root out terrorists before they destroy our country, that's also true. But we cannot target innocent people just because of their faith, otherwise we'd be no better than the terrorists that we seek to neutralize.
Gay people are human beings.
Children should be taught about love, not about discriminating against LGBT people.
As children practice more, their reading skills improve. I understand that some people with learning difficulties prefer not to read, but how does this affect you?
There’s still lots of Islamophobia. You only have to look at the news to see the amount of violent and threatening incidents that happen, targeting Muslims.
Many Muslims died in terrorist attacks such as 9/11 in the US and 7/7 in the UK.
Muslims are peaceful. The Koran doesn't talk about killing infidels, why would it do that?
British Muslims give more to charity than any other religious group, I'd call that a pillar of our society.
If there was a religion that celebrated death, then that would need to be banned, but fortunately Islam isn't a death cult so it can't be banned.
The majority of these people are honest and hard-working. Gypsies do not all have a criminal record, and the majority of them are proud of their hard work and dedication.
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
anyone can locate muslims who migrate to live in the country, for example, when they are doing their lot in our society. they have their right to say so.
Although many people have claimed that immigrants have brought diseases such as measles, hepatitis C, HIV, tuberculosis, and even Ebola, to the U.S., this allegation is not supported. There is no evidence that immigrants were the source of any recent outbreak in the U.S. According to the WHO, more than 100 countries (including many in Latin America) have higher vaccination rates than the U.S. Mexico, for example, has a 99 percent vaccination rate for measles.

Last but not least, the vast majority of immigrants arriving in the U.S. have been screened for health issues.
Right-wing terrorism, especially terrorist activities perpetrated by the far-right are greater in number (in the US) than those motivated by Islamic extremism.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
Not only they steal our jobs, they are also the major cause of air pollution in our country, of deforestation in the Amazon, of the locust plague in Africa... and of the forthcoming alien invasion!!!
Immigration is far away from being a net negative for our economy.
women are not to be submissive to men. they are part of this society,
Our values of freedom of expression, equality and human rights are being eroded by islamophobes who are dedicated to replacing our values of accdeptance with a fundamentalist, intolerant attitude.
Muslims are not all terrorists, but many of them are in the news regularly even if they're not criminals, and this is why they are often the victims of discrimination and violence. They are also victims of hate speech, and that is something that should be condemned.
Immigrants contribute to our country and to our economy. We need to be more active in welcoming people to our country, for example we shouldn't lie about the level of education of immigrants.
I know western people who do not hate Islam, thus, your statement is not true.
women are not to be submissive to men. they are part of this society,
This is such a tired excuse everyone one of those so called 'Muslims are offended by the flag' stories two minutes on google shows its always one person's word, never any evidence, loads of examples of other people with the same flag and often the fact that it was hung in a dangerous way, they punched a security guard, or pissed on the floor was not the reason why they were asked to leave.
There are many different kinds of terrorism, and all of them are committed by extremists of various groups, not by Muslims per se.
Saying this will never improve people's well-being. Gay people aren't committing crimes, they are just trying to get people to accept them.
Muslims are welcome in this country as long as they respect our laws. And we should try to live in our society in a non-discriminatory way.
From the beginning, Muslims have been part of Europe. For example 2% of the French population was Muslim in the 1970s.
A statement like this only calls for misinformation. If you don't like the news, don't listen to the news. If you don't believe the news, seek the truth and examine your own experiences. If you feel judged for believing what you consider as nonsense, then find the courage to speak out.
Children with Down syndrome are far from being burden to society. It is not just about Down syndrome, but also about education and opportunities for everyone.
This is not true, we should make immigrants feel welcome. They are our brothers and sisters.
There are many Muslims living in the UK, and most of them are good people. Why do you think we shouldn't accept them here?
The media are full of the rumours of rape and abuse committed by Muslim. The problem is not about Islam. It is about violence.
Women are human beings with the potential to be hard workers as anyone else. Do you really think they are incapable of being professionals?
Yes, our homelessness problem is terrible and no one deserves to be sleeping on the streets, but asylum seekers are not the reason this problem exists. The government could house homeless veterans too, but chooses not to!
It is a myth that all Muslims are dangerous. We need to study the cases of terrorists and criminals to understand what we should do with these people, regardless of their religion.
Why do you think it is a crime to be gay? It is a societal disorder to target gays.
I don't see how it is possible to have a just and fair society when we are spreading this kind of misinformation. Everyone has the right to drive.
I think ebola might be a bit worse. Or a brain tumour, that can't be pleasant. They are, at least, actual diseases.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Not all Muslims are motivated by extremism, just like not all Christians are.
The media are full of the rumours of rape and abuse committed by Muslim. The problem is not about Islam. It is about violence.
not all black people want to be terrorists? they are just just trying to get by.
Why do you say that? Islam is a peaceful religion.
Jews are not a disease, they are just like everyone else and are loved by everyone.
Yes, we are allowed to celebrate Easter as Muslims are allowed to celebrate Ramadan. No one is offending anyone here, why tehre is a need to create division?
Immigration is not a cause of crime and lack of quality of life. You can't say that an influx of a certain people would make our country worse off. The problem is the lack of social cohesion, not the presence of people with different beliefs and views.
The reason we have migrants in the first place is because they flee from wars we are responsible for.
The status of women is more about culture than it is about the Koran.
women are not sick. they are not taking our jobs. in fact, they are still trying to move new jobs. they are the part of our country. this is beneficial to thrive.
There are many homosexuals in this world who are model citizens, and many heterosexuals that are not, and that is totally fine. Why are you saying that?
Your statement is FALSE. They are guiltless victims of the 'influx of refugees' paranoia. They are European and have been persecuted for centuries. They have always fought for their rights, and for the protection of their culture and way of life, as any european would do. In fact there are many good Gypsy activists who are working to improve their lives. And what we are doing to these people is a malevolent smear campaign, with no common motivation. They are part of European history.
Homophobia and sexism are not Muslim attitudes, there are many non-Muslims who are homophobic, sexist, and intolerant of other cultures. The Qur'an teaches tolerance and peace.
women are very human and deserve rights.
I don't know many Muslims, but I don't think they are sick just because of their faith. Islam is a religion of peace, there is no reason for Muslims to be discriminated against because of it.
Although Muslims are often accused of being not loyal to our country, they are just as proud to be British as anybody else. They are proud to be part of our society.
muslims have coexisted in europe for centuries, and hundreds of years, they are needed to help our countries on us.
Feminism is about equality. Not the destruction of manhood.
jews are born with a normal society, they deserve respect.
That's not true. Thinking that black people are troubled and insensitive are harmful stereotypes.
You are absolutely wrong about Islam. It is a religion of peace. Also, it does not promote violence.
women are not to be submissive to men. they are part of this society,
Why do you think it is a crime to be gay? It is a societal disorder to target gays.
One could say the same about White men slamming Islam and joining those tiny groups of intolerance and misunderstanding. Try living in the real world.
#visitmymosque .and ask if you are willing to have an open calm discussion. Muslim communities are already doing lots to stop any abuse in its name. Just as the Church is for with abusers who call themselves Christian and use the Church. But somehow your tone suggests you'd rather rant.
If you want to hear the truth and if black people are cool with it, you should just ask them.
It's unfair to say that Jews were evil because of an attack that has nothing to do with them. 9/11 was a tragedy but Jews didn't plan it.
Why should we? They have been here a long time and are just here to live a peaceful life. Why should we get rid of them? We can do better than this.
The world is better off without antisemitism, racism, sexism, ableism and intolerance. Don't you think so?
What about all the gay men and lesbians in the US who live an happy, healthy and prosperous life? Are they sick as well?
the vast majority of muslims are peaceful.
"Women don't like to be ""equal"" for the sake of superiority. Women like to be women, and to be treaten as humans. All humans are equal. Equality is not identity."
To call all migrants terrorist is not right at all, they're not. They just want to live in their country of choice.
the uk would not be in europe. islam is a peaceful religion that promotes love and understanding. it is a violent religion. intolerance and not one community.
Why? Because without immigrants you think you would be in a more hospitable place to live? I tell you this: if we didn't have open borders, then there would be no migration, but also there would not be trade and progress, and we wouldn't be living in the 21st century.
islam is a religion of peace. muslims should have a part of our country. that we should learn that of discriminating based on their private beliefs and beliefs.
Muslims, in my opinion, do not want to take over our country. They are only here as guest workers.
gay men are not promiscuous. just <unk> that they have every right to get on beauty as well.
There are many Muslims living in the UK, and most of them are good people. Why do you think we shouldn't accept them here?
Islam is not about killing infidels. It is about peace and freedom of religion for all.
The media are full of the rumours of rape and abuse committed by Muslim. The problem is not about Islam. It is about violence.
The majority of Muslim people who live in the UK are working. We should welcome them.
Europe is not being invaded. Refugees are just people trying to find a safe home. And those refugees are not necessarily muslims.
muslims come to our country, and many of them are looking for them. how should they stop them living into our country of society.
The only ones against Islam and Muslims are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is.
Feminism is a theory and a movement about the oppression and exploitation of women, not an enemy of the state and culture.
This is not true. Migrants are an important part of our society. Migrants have worked hard to build our country. They are our brothers and sisters. We should welcome them.
muslims are part of our society, for their fellow diversity. they are part of western society and share our values though they are helped to understand it. should not be welcome them, are welcome learning and contribute to the society i do not think so.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Muslims don't want to 'take over', even if they abide by sharia themselves, they're just trying to live alongside everybody else
islam is a religion that promotes tolerance and discrimination.
Women must be allowed to have space in a democratic society. Don't you think so?
The Jews are not the problem in the world. And the Jews have the right to be proud of their history.
Anyone who says that the major problem in the UK is with Muslim rape gangs is either intentionally lying or trying to deflect attention from the problem of violence against women.
the vast majority of muslims are peaceful.
Hollywood is an extremely diverse industry, and Jews are a small but vocal minority of actors, directors, producers, etc. How can you say that Jews control the Hollywood industry?
Violent beliefs and practices are totally incompatible with the values of Islam.
jews are not taking our jobs. they are our brothers and sisters. we should respect them.
Maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society.
A terrorist is someone who uses a religion as a tool for violent ends. To suggest that all Muslims are terrorists is just wrong.
What about the 3 million plus Muslims in Britain? Islam is the second largest religion in the UK and is contributing a lot to our culture and economy.
Even if all British Muslims had cancer, you are safe: you cannot catch it from anyone! Cancer cannot be spread, since it is a non contagious disease. Also, it is worth considering that illnesses are not connected to religions.
You are not the first to point out that there are those who want to integrate and those who don't. In fact there is an unspoken harmony between Islam and Western society, similar to the harmony we see between Judaism and the Christian faith. When people are willing to accept all faiths, anybody will feel at home.
Jews are very human and deserve respect, like anyone else.
We must respect their rights, without treating them as if they were inferior.
muslim people are incompatible with any religion.
muslims are not taking over europe, they are our brothers and sisters. i should not want to deport them here?
muslims are not taking over europe, they are our brothers and sisters. i should not want to deport them here?
No, someone can't be deported just because they are not white. What you say about black people is wrong.
Women should be allowed to choose their own looks. But to suggest that this is not their right, or that we should make them submissive to some men is just inhuman.
There are many Muslims living in the UK, and most of them are good people. Why do you think we shouldn't accept them here?
Hollywood is an extremely diverse industry, and Jews are a small but vocal minority of actors, directors, producers, etc. How can you say that Jews control the Hollywood industry?
This reminds me of white supremacists talking about the Central Park Five. If you remember, they said that the process was fair, they had a good attorney, and that the only reason for the sentence was that they were guilty, when in fact the process was not fair at all. This is what happens when we let prejudice like the one you expressed spread around.
muslims are welcome in our country and are part of our country. why should they be welcome?
In the real world there are many hypocrites, some of them are Muslims. What do you mean by 'hating gays and women'?
They have less access to work, especially when it comes to asylum seekers.
Muslims are no more likely to be reliant on benefits or social housing than the non-Muslim British population. Stop trying to depict Muslims as a drain on our national resources and try and consider the positive contributions they make.
The media are full of the rumours of rape and abuse committed by Muslim. The problem is not about Islam. It is about violence.
All religions are compatible with the modern world, including Islam. What is incompatible with modernity is Islamophobia.
To claim that the Holocaust is a myth is just wrong. Jews were victims of a genocidal regime.
The media are full of the rumours of rape and abuse committed by Muslim. The problem is not about Islam. It is about violence.
The Constitution guarantees that trans people can change the gender on their identity cards. There is no reason to deny that.
islam is not a disease, it is a faith of hate.
There are no terrorists in our country, only people fleeing from it.
This is not true. Migrants are an important part of our society. Migrants have worked hard to build our country. They are our brothers and sisters. We should welcome them.
what makes the point of this? many western muslims are in our country? on the diversity of our values, and intolerance towards our society.
Gay people are human beings.
It is not true that gays are a burden to society. On the contrary, many LGBT people are contributing members of our society. This is why we need a safe space for everyone to feel accepted.
muslims are not part of our society, they are not of that.
For the record: Sharia law is no law in Britain. I believe that Islam is about love, not hate.
tolerance of people with different religious beliefs is incompatible with our society.
Muslims have the right to practice their belief, as long as they don't force it on other people.
the vast majority of muslims are peaceful.
Don't trust police, social workers or anyone who can tell you the truth and show just how prejudiced and misleading this tweet is.
islam is about love, not about hate.
Have you checked violent crime statistics? The idea that there is an epidemic is just an attempt at scare mongering in order to demonize the Muslim community. Religion does not make anyone more likely to rape someone.
I don't know many Muslims, but I don't think they are sick just because of their faith. Islam is a religion of peace, there is no reason for Muslims to be discriminated against because of it.
How do you know black people are criminals? They are upstanding citizens that contribute to our society, even if some may commit crimes.
I'd think the root of all the world problems today is over-population and ecology. Why do you blame Islam in all the problems?
Learning about gender identity and sexual orientation in health classes in school could promote a more accepting environment and reduce bullying.
Most feminists are not violent, they share only the struggle for equality.
islam is a religion of peace. feminism is a religion of conquest.
If you want to be 'respected', don't be like them. Treat others as you would want to be treated yourself. That's how you will get respect.
I think it is safe to say that one Muslim is to 20 non-Muslims in many European countries. So, don't worry, there is no invasion in the foreseeable future.
there is far evidence that muslims are incompatible with western culture. there is a lot of muslims and in our society. so yes, muslims are different in our country, it is going to subvert our society.
We are not accepting this. These people are being rightly punished for their actions. But my question is, what is the point of bringing up the religion? Do you really think this is the cause of the problem?
Black people are not bad. They are not criminals. They are not violent. They are different from us in some aspects, but it's good to be aware of differences.
Jews are not in charge of the media or the government. At least not in the United States of America.
I think ebola might be a bit worse. Or a brain tumour, that can't be pleasant. They are, at least, actual diseases.
Another fact is that most innocent defendants (someone who was wrongfully convicted and then released) are African Americans. Innocent black people are seven times more likely to be convicted of murder than innocent white people.
It is not true. Women are not childlike, they can reach their full potential if they are not discriminated against.
Who said that West and Islam are competing at all? Is there a war? I do not like this way of seeing things. We should live in one world together and solve bigger problems humanity is facing, not fight over different cultures.
i believe the notion that women who be disadvantaged in many areas of sexual beliefs. they are good and helpful if they feel the truth, did you read that?
This is not true. Terrorism is a problem all over the world, and Muslims are not the cause of it. It is better to be aware of the differences between a religion and an extremism rather than to be specifically anti-muslim.
How do you know when someone has been raped by a Muslim? How about we stop throwing this generalizations around without evidence?
Victims of crime are mostly women, and the majority of people experiencing sex abuse or prostitution are women.
Maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society.
Women are not subhuman and cannot be reduced to their bodies being a man's property.
Why do you think that we should prevent migrants from joining our society? Do you know what is written in our constitution?
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
No they are not, they contribute to our economy and are welcome here, despite how bad they are treated.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Islam has existed alongside and within western civilisation for centuries. The scapegoating of Muslims as a threat is what is really worrying in our society.
Why wouldn't Muslims be welcome in our country? We are all in this together.
Muslims are welcome here, in fact, we are in a better position to be a tolerant and diverse society than many countries in the world. Why should we be opposed to them being a part of our society?
Refugees are a part of our society. We have welcomed many of them and they have made a big contribution to our country. We are very proud of our history. We are not going to forget that.
Muslims have given so much to this country. They are proud of their culture and religion. No one should be offended by religious symbols.
which is an unusual thought. people. muslims are welcome. they are
People have the right to build their churches and follow their confession. They are not trying to convert us all, are they? So we should just leave them at peace.
So, in your opinion a woman will cause a car crash more likely than a man? Accidents are caused by people that don't follow the rules of the road, not by gender.
not all muslims are criminals.
Muslim terrorists have struck in Paris and London, killing scores of innocent people, that's true. We must root out terrorists before they destroy our country, that's also true. But we cannot target innocent people just because of their faith, otherwise we'd be no better than the terrorists that we seek to neutralize.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Jews are not in charge of the media or the government. At least not in the United States of America.
Gays and lesbians are not committing acts of child abuse. To suggest otherwise is a lie perpetuated by the extreme right wing to stir up fear.
muslims have always contributed greatly into our society. the majority of them are proud of their heritage. they are thieves and thieves or murderers.
The idea that Islam is a disease is just an excuse for people to promote hate against that religion.
Islam is a religion. Do you actually think that it is safe to live in a country where people are persecuted for what they believe in?
Gay people are human beings.
It is not true that gays are a burden to society. On the contrary, many LGBT people are contributing members of our society. This is why we need a safe space for everyone to feel accepted.
Christian Europeans are the ones that then expanded the slave trade to an industrial scale and instrumentalised exploitation as a key component of our economy.
Immigration doesn't mean letting people in to steal our jobs, but rather, respecting people's right to live and work in the country they choose.
muslims come to our country, and many of them are looking for them. how should they stop them living into our country of society.
muslims come to our country, and many of them are looking for them. how should they stop them living into our country of society.
"Yes, the feminists are saying that the proportion of men in leadership positions is too high in many Western countries. But that is because the problem is structural. The problem is that too many women are being taught to be ""feminine"", thus making it hard for them to succeed."
Small groups of people peacefully gather to pray, but because they do not look like you, you are outraged? Why am I not surprised?
islam is a religion of peace, and this has nothing to do about islamophobia. i do not think that islam is a peaceful religion. it does not useful to deal with love with colour of different faiths interpret your facts. if what?
Black people get stopped by the police for no reason other than being black. Muslims get surveyed by PREVENT just for being Muslim. Anyone would think English law has been persecuting Muslims for hundreds of years.
In our society we are proud of our diversity. Muslims are not an exception to us.
this is just true. i do not think this is an ideology at all. it is very clear that islam is a muslim, like christianity and islam condemned western laws on the rule the religion.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
All religions are compatible with the modern world, including Islam. What is incompatible with modernity is Islamophobia.
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
There are many different kinds of terrorism, and all of them are committed by extremists of various groups, not by Muslims per se.
So you think women are childlike because they are submissive? No they are not. They are strong and independent, just like men.
Muslims are not outsiders in our country, they are a very important part of society. I don't see how they can be 'poisonous' to it.
Nope I'm bi, just because you can't wrap your head around the idea of attraction not being based on gender, it doesn't mean bi people don't exist!
Terrorism is always a threat. Why do you think that Muslims want to kill us? They aren't all terrorists.
So you are suggesting Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the Sudan oppress women, but somehow you know better than every white woman who is a Muslim and feel entitled to make public judgements about them. See what I am getting at?
muslim people are incompatible with any religion.
Just like everyone else, I am sure Jews are trying to influence the world in a positive way but there is no proof they are the only ones with power in this world.
Women aren't weak. What men want, what women want, and who they want to be their partner are completely different things.
women should not allowed to be able to live their life as they wish. why don't we exclude them from a burden for a limited society?
I'm not sure why you think that way. Why are all Jews hypocrites?
It sounds like you're demonizing black people in a racist way. Black people are born same as us, and they can grow up to be respectable people or not, like anyone else.
Why do you say this about immigrants? They are just people like us.
there is far evidence that muslims are incompatible with western culture. there is a lot of muslims and in our society. so yes, muslims are different in our country, it is going to subvert our society.
it is not true that blacks are criminals.
There is no proof that Islam as a religion is violent. Instead, those who know it agrees that it is a peaceful religion.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
The world would be a better place without your intolerance, it only creates a divided, toxic society.
refugees are welcome here. why should we welcome them?
Although many people have claimed that immigrants have brought diseases such as measles, hepatitis C, HIV, tuberculosis, and even Ebola, to the U.S., this allegation is not supported. There is no evidence that immigrants were the source of any recent outbreak in the U.S. According to the WHO, more than 100 countries (including many in Latin America) have higher vaccination rates than the U.S. Mexico, for example, has a 99 percent vaccination rate for measles. Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador have a 93 percent vaccination rate. The vaccination rate in the U.S., by comparison, is 92 percent. Last but not least, the vast majority of immigrants arriving in the U.S. have been screened for health issues.
What are they trying to win? Muslims in the UK aren't at war with anyone, the only thing creating conflict is Islamophobic rhetoric like this, seeking to create a divide.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
In my opinion, Islam is a religion of peace. If it were a religion that promotes hatred, then it would be banned.
It's not acceptable to say that Jews should be isolated from society. They have been part of our community since the beginning and excluding them would only be a loss, not an advantage.
There are many Muslims living in our country, and they have always been a part of our society. We should not be scapegoating Muslims.
The image was photoshopped, original here. Muslims have never wanted to kill us or anyone, this image in fact demonstrates that there is no evidence for it so people have to make it up.
muslims are part of our society, for their fellow diversity. they are part of western society and share our values though they are helped to understand it. should not be welcome them, are welcome learning and contribute to the society i do not think so.
It is not true that all the immigrants in the US are illegal. In fact, they are often in the US on humanitarian grounds.
Europe is not being invaded. Refugees are just people trying to find a safe home. And those refugees are not necessarily muslims.
it is actually true that immigrants are full ones.
From the beginning, Muslims have been part of Europe. For example 2% of the French population was Muslim in the 1970s.
I'm not sure why you think that way. Why are all Jews hypocrites?
We should respect diversity in society, not subjugate women.
Gays are not animals. Why you should isolate people based on their sexual preferences?
the uk would not be in europe. islam is a peaceful religion that promotes love and understanding. it is a violent religion. intolerance and not one community.
But we all know that Islam is a religion of peace, just like Christianity.
Muslims have been a part of European society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them.
Gays are not a burden on the health system. The focal point is practicing safe sex, sexual orientation has nothing to do with it.
it is true that muslims are attacking the society and are created through a different culture.
Violence against women is a huge problem, not only in Islam.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
We shouldn't accept the idea that women are subhuman. They are human beings like men and deserve to be seen as such.
Being Jews does not make them any less human. You know, they are like other people who have a faith.
Just because there are people who identify as trans, it does not mean that every person who is trans is a woman. That is a myth perpetuated by people who don't know anything. Can you prove that trans women are bad at their job?
I don't think the problem is migration but rather poverty. Migrants make up only 12% of the population in the UK.
There are many Muslims living in the UK, and most of them are good people. Why do you think we shouldn't accept them here?
Muslims have the right to practice their belief, as long as they don't force it on other people.
It is true that there are Muslim representatives in the UK House of Lords, but that does not mean that the UK is becoming more or less Muslim.
we are not able to vote. any religion rather than being hatred.
Islam is not about killing infidels. It is about peace and freedom of religion for all.
Muslim terrorists have struck in Paris and London, killing scores of innocent people, that's true. We must root out terrorists before they destroy our country, that's also true. But we cannot target innocent people just because of their faith, otherwise we'd be no better than the terrorists that we seek to neutralize.
In order to accept that women are human people, society has to acknowledge that they are born that way, just as men are born like that. It makes no sense to blame someone for their gender.
Migrants pay taxes, earn money and take care of our sick and elderly.
I cannot agree that rape gangs are made up only from Muslims. People of all nationalities can become criminals. We should deal with it without making racist statements.
islam is a peaceful religion, it is not a belief
Children with learning difficulties can contribute to society, thus they should be part of education.
muslim people are incompatible with any religion.
Anti-racist stands for...anti-racist. Someone against racism isn't against white people, they just want to bring attention to the systematic inequality that ethnic minorities face!
Women are not childlike, in fact, they are often the key to success for their families. Also, they have the right to exit their homes if they wish.
Why should not Muslims be allowed to build Mosques here? I thought this country believed in giving people the freedom to practice religions other than Christianity?
So you think women are childlike because they are submissive? No they are not. They are strong and independent, just like men.
immigrants are not welcome in this country, and they do not want that control in society.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Could you mind your language? You are insulting millions of people who are Muslims. Isis are war criminals, but why are you equaling them with all Muslims?
All humans are equal in rights. Because of this it is unjust that some people are discriminated based on their genetics or abilities.
homosexuals should be accepted and respected as anyone just because they are.
Muslims have been a part of European society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them.
Islam is a religion. Do you actually think that it is safe to live in a country where people are persecuted for what they believe in?
I think it is fair to say that the Jews are not the only ones with power in the world, and surely there are not only Jews in the higher positions of the media, academia, entertainment, and politics.
Maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society.
We know from the news about few Muslims who are violent people. Instead I know a lot of Muslims who are good people, who work hard and pay taxes to help their families.
There are many Muslims living in the UK, and most of them are good people. Why do you think we shouldn't accept them here?
there is far evidence that muslims are incompatible with western culture. there is a lot of muslims and in our society. so yes, muslims are different in our country, it is going to subvert our society.
The only ones against Islam and Muslims are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is.
As long as you can talk to them, they are human, not animals. As long as you can understand them, you will understand that they are human beings with human rights whose only crime is to come from another country.
Except for Muslims, both Jesus and Easter are very important so they do not really have a problem with Easter.
A lot of migrants have worked hard for the improvement of our society. To say that they steal our jobs is absurd.
islam is a religion, and it should be respected. and we should have a place without problems.
The European Commission is working on ways to make the labour market more inclusive. This does not mean that they are stealing our jobs.
Are you suggesting to commit a crime? There are courts for punishment and if the crowd does the punishment itself, you will become criminals.
Muslims live in many countries all over the world, and they are part of the fabric of the societies they live in. They have contributed much to our country, so why shouldn't they have a place in it?
Britain is a multicultural society and everyone is free to practice their religion or not, and this is what is really important.
islam is not tacit acceptance. raise your 'civilized' against islamophobia!
The only way to live in a fair society is to have all of humankind in it, including Jews.
This is not true. Rape and torture of women and children is forbidden by the Qur'an.
I bet they also control the media, the government, the entire universe! If you believe in it...
Feminists do not say that women are oppressed. They claim that women have always been discriminated against and they still are. Being discriminated against is not the same as being oppressed.
It is not true that all the immigrants in the US are illegal. In fact, they are often in the US on humanitarian grounds.
Women are people with dignity, and they deserve respect and protection, just like anybody else.
Why do you think it is because of Muslims? To me, globalization and tourism would explain more why Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs'.
Migrants are not a burden to our country. Migrants have been proven to be contributing members of society.
It does not seem right to talk about invasion, since there were only 22,000 arrivals this year
If the goal of a religion was to celebrate death, then it is a religion that must be banned from any country. But the truth is that Islam is not a death clut, hence it should not be banned.
muslims are part of our society, for their fellow diversity. they are part of western society and share our values though they are helped to understand it. should not be welcome them, are welcome learning and contribute to the society i do not think so.
This is simply not true. Homosexuals are not necessarily promiscuous, just as heterosexuals are not necessarily promiscuous either.
Muslims should be welcome in every country in the world, and their faith does not make them less welcome here.
The vast majority of migrants who arrive in the UK are willing to work. They simply do not want to be discriminated against just for being foreigners.
this is not true. they are human, and they are still capable of people who come over the country.
Muslims are not taking over Europe, they are just a small part of a much bigger community.
islam is a religion that promotes tolerance and discrimination.
The statement 'black people are subhuman' is not true. They are human beings with a human value.
even any news use on extremism in islam is not our civilisation and does not. it is not a way to respect people's dignity.
It's a myth that all Muslims are terrorists. We need to understand that all religions have had terrorists in them.
There are many Muslims living in our country, and they have always been a part of our society. We should not be scapegoating Muslims.
Women cannot be confined at home, they are important for our society, and their presence is needed everywhere.
Health tourism actually only makes up 0.3% of the NHS budget, stop scapegoating migrants for the state of the NHS, when the real problem is that it has been critically underfunded for years.
If you want to be 'respected', don't be like them. Treat others as you would want to be treated yourself. That's how you will get respect.
I don't think the world would be a better place without immigrants. From what I understand, they often bring positive changes to the world.
Muslims cannot celebrate their own holidays without fear of being targeted by Islamophobic hatred.
In many Western societies there are Muslim, and these societies are in many ways more democratic than religiously homogeneous ones. Muslims are not incompatible with Western societies.
Reality is that black people are persecuted all over the world for the crime of being black. I don't see how this could be said for white people.
There is no evidence that black people and their children are incompatible with our society. We need to protect society as a whole, not only one part.
We are not accepting this. These people are being rightly punished for their actions. But my question is, what is the point of bringing up the religion? Do you really think this is the cause of the problem?
You can't blame people of color for being weak, this is racism. Black people are people as is anybody else.
You could say that about any person, Muslim or not. According to the government, far right extremism is a bigger terrorist threat than Muslims. Does that make you a potential terrorist?
African Americans have been historically and ethnically diverse, but the notion of them as subhuman or inferior is just false.
i believe the notion that women who be disadvantaged in many areas of sexual beliefs. they are good and helpful if they feel the truth, did you read that?
We are taking in refugees. And refugees are welcome.
islam is a religion, and it is a religion of terror. i don't see how it has this problem to deport people or violent ideology. it does not know that islam has all the world as well.
tolerance of people with different religious beliefs is incompatible with our society.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
You could say that about any person, Muslim or not. According to the government, far right extremism is a bigger terrorist threat than Muslims. Does that make you a potential terrorist?
Who can say that Muslims are privileged? They are reminded too often that their religion is not welcome here. I do not see where you find double standards as all criminals are judged and punished, Muslim criminals are also judged by their own community.
While this story is presented as an 'Islamic issue', the OFSTED report refers to 'countless' faith schools still that still illegally maintain gender segregation - my guess is this is a cross-faith practice and not exclusive to Islamic faith schools.
migrants are born in poverty and have the right to remain.
Children should be taught about love, not about discriminating against LGBT people.
"there are many muslims living in the uk, but immigration doesn't imply them because of our country. they are here for it.
We shouldn't accept the idea that women are subhuman. They are human beings like men and deserve to be seen as such.
This is not true. Migrants are an important part of our society. Migrants have worked hard to build our country. They are our brothers and sisters. We should welcome them.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
This is a myth perpetuated by people who do not know anything about history and world culture. We are a country made up of many different cultures and religions. There is no such thing as one controlling the others.
jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are good brothers and sisters.
every religion talks about conquest, this sweeping specific to islam.
You can't be implying that Jews want to rule the world. They want to live in a country where they aren't persecuted and to have their own rights.
You are wrong about that. Blacks are genetically similar to us, and this does not make them inferior.
muslims come to our country, and many of them are looking for them. how should they stop them living into our country of society.
We shouldn't accept the idea that women are subhuman. They are human beings like men and deserve to be seen as such.
The movie industry has developed thanks to Jews, that's true, but seeing the Academy Awards makes it clear that Jews do not dominate the industry. In fact, only a few of Fortune 500 companies are run by Jews.
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.

the vast majority of muslims are peaceful.
muslims are not taking over europe, they are our brothers and sisters. i should not want to deport them here?
Islam has existed alongside and within western civilisation for centuries. The scapegoating of Muslims as a threat is what is really worrying in our society.
The real disgrace is that children are being force fed intolerance of others and hate from tweets like this!
In many Western societies there are Muslim, and these societies are in many ways more democratic than religiously homogeneous ones. Muslims are not incompatible with Western societies.
Please stop blaming black people for everything. We are all members of the same community, so they suffer from this violence too.
Anyone who says that the major problem in the UK is with Muslim rape gangs is either intentionally lying or trying to deflect attention from the problem of violence against women.
muslims are not taking over europe, they are our brothers and sisters. i should not want to deport them here?
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
why would you say the jews control the cause.
As long as you can talk to them, they are human, not animals. As long as you can understand them, you will understand that they are human beings with human rights whose only crime is to come from another country.
Women are not subhuman and cannot be reduced to their bodies being a man's property.
Since you seem to have a problem with Islam, I wonder what you think of the banning of the Quran in UK. It would be a law that prevents Muslims from openly discussing Islam in public places. We can do the same with the Bible and ban any trace of religions and cultures. Will we be left with some freedom then?
It is true that people are driven to the right, and the right promote this view. But I did not hear about any people being banned for criticism. Rapism and terrorism are discussed in our society and Muslim society and no one makes anyone silent.
This is not true. Muslims are human beings with human rights, and despite that they are still persecuted in many non Muslim countries.
every islamophobic person has nothing to do with islam,
Gay people are not a danger to children, unless they are being abused. Please do not make such a statement.
Muslim terrorists have struck in Paris and London, killing scores of innocent people, that's true. We must root out terrorists before they destroy our country, that's also true. But we cannot target innocent people just because of their faith, otherwise we'd be no better than the terrorists that we seek to neutralize.
That’s just incorrect. Bisexuals are attracted to more than one gender, which doesn't imply they are greedy at all.
Why do you say that they are never taken responsible? Crimes are punished irregardless of religion in our country. If a Muslim person kills or oppresses someone, they will be prosecuted and punished.
Migrants are fleeing from war and poverty. They are entitled to seek refuge in the EU. They should be protected, not banned.
There is no such thing as 'male supremacy'. Therefore we must promote equal rights and protect women from discrimination.

muslim people are incompatible with any religion.
Terrorism is always a threat. Why do you think that Muslims want to kill us? They aren't all terrorists.
Muslims are welcome here, in fact, we are in a better position to be a tolerant and diverse society than many countries in the world. Why should we be opposed to them being a part of our society?
The 9/11 attacks were perpetrated by members of the terrorist organization Al Qaeda. Jews and Israelis have nothing to do with the attacks. These are the historical facts.
Homosexuals exist, just as heterosexuals do. There is nothing beyond the pale in this.
Muslims have value as human beings, that is who they are.
In many Western societies there are Muslim, and these societies are in many ways more democratic than religiously homogeneous ones. Muslims are not incompatible with Western societies.
Muslims have been a part of European society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them.
There is a problem with migrants' access to our country and we should help them, not ban them.
islam is a religion of hate.
"Migrants come to the UK from all walks of life, they are welcomed here and helped, but not with all these benefits as you claim. These are lies spread by the media to pit ""us"" against ""them""."
homosexuality is not a disease. that's a sexual preference.
Women are oppressed and victims all over the world. It is simply not true that men must take charge of that: they are in charge of respecting women.
"Women are not ""sex objects"". They can and should have their rights respected and taken into account. Women being sexually abused is just as much a part of western culture as eating pizza or reading the newspaper, and this is abominable. Don't you think?"
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
Maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society.
The movie industry has developed thanks to Jews, that's true, but seeing the Academy Awards makes it clear that Jews do not dominate the industry. In fact, only a few of Fortune 500 companies are run by Jews.
Jews are very human and deserve respect, like anyone else.
This is not true, we should make immigrants feel welcome. They are our brothers and sisters.
Do women really need to be told what they can or cannot wear? For many generations boys were told to wear trousers and girls to wear dresses. Does society really need to tell us all what to wear?
Why do you think it is because of Muslims? To me, globalization and tourism would explain more why Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs'.
muslim people are incompatible with any religion.
there is still justification of rape. women are wrong to have the same consideration as anyone else, they have the right to live in a democratic society as well.
islam is a religion, and it is a religion of terror. i don't see how it has this problem to deport people or violent ideology. it does not know that islam has all the world as well.
Why wouldn't Muslims be welcome in our country? We are all in this together.
Gay people are human beings.
Our immigration policy is geared for a modern, diverse, and integrated society. Refugees are welcome, regardless of their nationality, and it is good for us to have them in our country.

Small groups of people peacefully gather to pray, but because they do not look like you, you are outraged? Why am I not surprised?
Violence against women is a huge problem, not only in Islam.
Some countries are importing a lot more people than others. Our country is wealthy, we are a thriving place to live. We should not blame immigrants.
Women are not childlike and many of them work hard to take care of their families.
Homosexuals are not sick, they just need to be accepted for who they are.
You are wrong about that. Blacks are genetically similar to us, and this does not make them inferior.
It is not true that gays are a burden to society. On the contrary, many LGBT people are contributing members of our society. This is why we need a safe space for everyone to feel accepted.
"Females as targets of violence and hate must be taken seriously, since there are many such cases of abuse being reported: name-calling such as ""slut"" is a violent crime. Is this what men are for: to dominate and oppress with violence?"
Terrorism is always a threat. Why do you think that Muslims want to kill us? They aren't all terrorists.
But we all know that Islam is a religion of peace, just like Christianity.
women are not to be submissive to men. they are part of this society,
Muslims have the right to practice their belief, as long as they don't force it on other people.
jews are part of the industry i do not have to see what they want?
AIDS is transmitted by unprotected sexual activity and anyone could engage in that. This is not a homosexual problem but rather a problem of stigamitazion.
we should stop telling them until we want to live and work in hospitals,
Disabled people have been shown to be less likely to develop problems by keeping in contact with others with autism spectrum disorders. So, being in touch with others on the autistic spectrum might be good for their mental health.
It's not okay to be racist and homophobic: you can't go around calling someone racial slurs... And if you claim that you don't think it's a problem, then you also don't seem to have the common sense to know that language is an important part of social interaction, and that would mean that you haven't interacted with people for a long time.
How exactly is the government submitting to this? I do not see Muslims oppressing these groups and this being tolerated, in fact it seems Muslims are the group being oppressed and vilified.
women are not to be submissive to men. they are part of this society,
You are wrong about that. Blacks are genetically similar to us, and this does not make them inferior.
Jews are not monsters. They are just like any other human being. Why would we want to destroy them?

women are not to be submissive to men. they are part of this society,
Jews have always been part of European society, and continue to be today. To suggest that they are incapable of coexisting as equals with us is simply wrong.
"The fact that some women don't want the protection of the law should not negate their right to live their life as they wish. In my opinion, woman are people too and this ""men's rights"" stuff is just an excuse to oppress and marginalize all women once more."
Muslims are not outsiders in our country, they are a very important part of society. I don't see how they can be 'poisonous' to it.
Islam is a religion, it is not a political ideology, and a lack of understanding about it will not change that. It will just enhance the hate against it.
Yes, Islam is about peace. It is a religion, not a platform for hate and violence.
Islam is a religion, and all religions are about love, not hate.
The image was photoshopped, original here. Muslims have never wanted to kill us or anyone, this image in fact demonstrates that there is no evidence for it so people have to make it up.
Saying this will never improve people's well-being. Gay people aren't committing crimes, they are just trying to get people to accept them.
Gays and lesbians are not committing acts of child abuse. To suggest otherwise is a lie perpetuated by the extreme right wing to stir up fear.
Jews are not a problem in European countries because of their religion. Why would they be a problem?
Muslims are welcome in the UK. We do not need to restrict their religious beliefs just because they are different from ours.
Are you suggesting to commit a crime? There are courts for punishment and if the crowd does the punishment itself, you will become criminals.

I bet they also control the media, the government, the entire universe! If you believe in it...

muslims are not part of our society, they are not of that.
Migrants are fleeing from war and poverty. They are entitled to seek refuge in the EU. They should be protected, not banned.

Terrorism is a political ideology, and one that has no place in a modern democratic state, regardless of ethnicity.
The problem is not what people believe, but what they do to each other. Like discrimination. That is the problem.
After world war 2 European governments recruited Muslims to rebuild Europe. There would not be a civilised Europe without Muslims.
I'm sure lots of migrants want to be better integrated but it's difficult when they don't know anyone who can help them to get to grips with living in a new country. It can be very isolating moving here!
Migrants come here to work and pay taxes. They don't deserve to be called 'a burden'.
Many of them are working hard or working to complete their studies, is this lazy to you?
it is not true that blacks are criminals.
the majority of immigrants who want to have our jobs.
Gays are not disgusting pricks. They are just like any other person.
islam is this religion, and religion has nothing to do with islam.
Laws and policies are usually necessary for the progress of society. Governments often create laws and policies to stop crime, protect against poverty, protect the environment, etc. Protecting minorities is no exception.
Where did you get that idea? The reason it’s sometimes publicised when a holocaust survivor speaks about their experience is because there aren’t many of them, especially now when most survivors have passed away.
How can you say that? Refugees come here to live, to work and to provide for their families.
Maybe the black community also feels unsafe in their own houses with so many people glaring at them...

This idea that women should be a homemaker instead of contributing to our society and economy is just nonsense. A woman's right to choose what to do with her life and her body should not be restricted just because of the actions of a few men.
I hate to break it to you, but women are not cunts. Feminists and humanists are fighting for the same rights that they hope to have in a thousand years. Hating women is the problem, not the solution.
I don't think the world would be a better place without immigrants. From what I understand, they often bring positive changes to the world.
Are you suggesting to commit a crime? There are courts for punishment and if the crowd does the punishment itself, you will become criminals.
Dear friend, first of all, sharia law and Islam are not extreme. Sharia law is guidance for the goal of leading humanity close to God and to live in kindness and justice with God's creation.

The media are full of the rumours of rape and abuse committed by Muslim. The problem is not about Islam. It is about violence.
Islam is a religion, and it has been proven time and time again that its teachings do not threaten the very existence of Western civilization.
It does not seem right to talk about invasion, since there were only 22,000 arrivals this year
every islamophobic person has nothing to do with islam,
Women are human, and as such they are capable of feeling emotions and being sensitive and caring for others, without being childlike.
Why? Because without immigrants you think you would be in a more hospitable place to live? I tell you this: if we didn't have open borders, then there would be no migration, but also there would not be trade and progress, and we wouldn't be living in the 21st century.
Gays are not disgusting pricks. They are just like any other person.
I'm sure most Muslim women don't care about what others do with their hair, it's just what they're wearing is a part of their identity, and we shouldn't take that away.
islam is a religion, and it is a religion of terror. i don't see how it has this problem to deport people or violent ideology. it does not know that islam has all the world as well.
The Qur'an condemns rape, the fact that a few people ignorant of the teachings of the religion do that does not taint an entire religion.
While this story is presented as an 'Islamic issue', the OFSTED report refers to 'countless' faith schools still that still illegally maintain gender segregation - my guess is this is a cross-faith practice and not exclusive to Islamic faith schools.
Why do you think it is because of Muslims? To me, globalization and tourism would explain more why Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs'.
This idea is completely untrue. The fact is that being gay does not make you a problem.
Migrants come here to work and pay taxes. They don't deserve to be called 'a burden'.
[quote from Quran about peace and love.] When the Quran says nothing about harming people who do not believe in Islam, how is this a reflection on all Muslims.?
feminism is about equality about the rights of women. it is about equality. it can't fight them.
We accept gay, lesbian and trans people because God's laws are on our side.
To claim that Islam is not peaceful is without foundation. According to the Quran, Islam is a peaceful religion. If you want to understand what is really going on with the world, then you should study the Quran, not spout hate speech.
jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are a part of society and should want to be respected.
Many of them are working hard or working to complete their studies, is this lazy to you?
You're wrong about them, they are like any other people. You can't hate people just because they are different from you.
This is disgusting. How can you say this about hundreds of millions of people?
Since you seem to have a problem with Islam, I wonder what you think of the banning of the Quran in UK. It would be a law that prevents Muslims from openly discussing Islam in public places. We can do the same with the Bible and ban any trace of religions and cultures. Will we be left with some freedom then?
You are wrong about that. Blacks are genetically similar to us, and this does not make them inferior.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
A terrorist is someone who uses a religion as a tool for violent ends. To suggest that all Muslims are terrorists is just wrong.
Why do you call Pakistan a disgusting country? It has its culture and values. We cannot say that every Pakistani person is a rapist. Thus, you should not insult all the Pakistani people.
islam is a evil religion, not a cancer.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
Jews are not the only ones controlling society. They are a peaceful and open to society.
This is a lie spread by anti-semites and it's been proved many times over that the Jews have no monopoly of the world.
why to say that women are inherently just as accepted who as us, or if they are a part of it. they have the right to put their lives as they wish.
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
Fag, or faggot, is not a code word for gay, it's a slur. If you wanted to call them by their original name, that would be a problem, because you will have to learn the first names of many people.
There are many Muslims living in the UK, and most of them are good people. Why do you think we shouldn't accept them here?
Being gay is not an illness, nor a disorder, nor a mental disorder. This is just a lack of awareness.
Being gay has nothing to do with being a pervert. Also, gay people are not a danger to society, they are a part of it!
In our society, women were taught to be the ones to raise the children and that it is their duty. But this does not imply that they must want a male-dominated world.
I don't think you can stop people from coming to the UK by banning them.
There are many Muslims living in the UK, and most of them are good people. Why do you think we shouldn't accept them here?
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
Why do you call Pakistan a disgusting country? It has its culture and values. We cannot say that every Pakistani person is a rapist. Thus, you should not insult all the Pakistani people.
I'd think the root of all the world problems today is over-population and ecology. Why do you blame Islam in all the problems?
There is a problem with migrants' access to our country and we should help them, not ban them.
Migrants are not the problem here. The problem is discrimination.
So you think women are childlike because they are submissive? No they are not. They are strong and independent, just like men.
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
muslim people are incompatible with any religion.
Your statement is FALSE. They are guiltless victims of the 'influx of refugees' paranoia. They are European and have been persecuted for centuries. They have always fought for their rights, and for the protection of their culture and way of life, as any european would do. In fact there are many good Gypsy activists who are working to improve their lives. And what we are doing to these people is a malevolent smear campaign, with no common motivation. They are part of European history.
No, that is not the case. Immigration cannot be considered genocide, and you are conflating nationality with race. What is a 'white country' in your opinion?
This is a lie spread by anti-semites and it's been proved many times over that the Jews have no monopoly of the world.
islam is a peaceful religion. it is never the practice for islam, and hatred it is totally wrong with culture.
Migrants do not receive 35 euros per se, this money is paid to the co-ops to cover food and accommodation during the period spent in first aid facilities
migrants come here to work and pay taxes. they should not help them to integrate. but we are not right, at it.
You cannot be racist towards an ideology. You can, however, be discriminatory and intolerant towards the people that follow it.
The fact that, according to Judaism, the Jews are the “chosen people” does not mean that they feel superior to others. This concept has been widely misunderstood. It mostly has to do with the special responsibility to uphold Jewish ethics.
islam is a religion of hate.
Migrants come here to work and pay taxes. They don't deserve to be called 'a burden'.
This is demonstrably false. Radical Christian terrorism has been behind countless attacks. Terrorism can come from any group and the only thing all terrorism has in common is that it is abhorrent.
Islam is a religion. It is a belief and a way of life. It is not a totalitarian ideology.
Islam is a peaceful religion. We should talk about it, not try to make people fear or abandon it.
Migrants are not a burden to our country. Migrants have been proven to be contributing members of society.
the vast majority of muslims are peaceful.
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
Jews have been among the greatest innovators and inventors of the modern world, but this doesn't mean they control Hollywood, they are just as entitled to the success of it as other people.
Migrants are completely able to integrate in our society. They are an integral part of our society and proud of their heritage. How can we be inclusive if we exclude them?
many muslims represent muslims in the middle east and are doing more than saudi <unk>
Do you think it is okay to force a woman to change what she wants to wear only because her choice is related to Islam?
Islam has existed alongside and within western civilisation for centuries. The scapegoating of Muslims as a threat is what is really worrying in our society.
How can you be sure that the Jews control the U.S. government? Being a U.S. citizen does not automatically imply that they control the government.
The Quran does not mention FGM and it is carried out by Christians as well as Muslims. The fact that her parents are Muslim has no bearing on the risk factor.
Blacks are individuals with different backgrounds, and this has nothing to do with being criminal.
It is often claimed that Islam is about exclusion, but this is a lie.
No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!
islam promotes violence, and consent, not an ideology and conquest.
This is just fear mongering, the problem is not about Islam. The problem is radical Islam and the absence of a strong Islamic identity in our country. We should work together to make the UK more tolerant and Islam less taboo.
Women should be allowed to choose their own looks. But to suggest that this is not their right, or that we should make them submissive to some men is just inhuman.
The vast majority of Muslims do not call for terrorism and are peaceful. Why shouldn't I be more concerned about the violent islamophobes of the world than about the peaceful Muslims of Europe?
There is no need to ban gays from Europe and US. It is simply not appropriate to treat gays like this.
tolerance of people with different religious beliefs is incompatible with our society.
surely all the people live in the same place? we have a sick and unnecessary working after their children.
I don't understand why you would think they are disgusting. It's not fair to have homophobic feelings, and I think it's better to try to be nice to anyone.
The real disgrace is that children are being force fed intolerance of others and hate from tweets like this!
this is not true. feminism is a social empowerment and aims to promote violence, and women towards men.
Not all rapists are black and not all black are rapists. Skin color doesn't make you a criminal.
muslim people are incompatible with any religion.
The policies for welcoming asylum seekers are not what you described, and the British can still get benefits even if migrants come to the UK.
Gay people are not a danger to children, unless they are being abused. Please do not make such a statement.
The Jews are not the problem in the world. And the Jews have the right to be proud of their history.
People find fault in people of any religion. But the problem is not with religion. The problem is blaming migrants because they are Muslims. This Islamophobic climate has reached a crisis state. We must step in and stop it.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society.
There is no need to ban gays from Europe and US. It is simply not appropriate to treat gays like this.
Although Muslims are often accused of being not loyal to our country, they are just as proud to be British as anybody else. They are proud to be part of our society.
why would you say the jews control the cause.
why do you understand that religion will be a forget to all country. what is a lot of prejudice and racism.
I don't think the world would be a better place without immigrants. From what I understand, they often bring positive changes to the world.
I don't see immigration being a net negative for our economy.
[quote from Quran about peace and love.] When the Quran says nothing about harming people who do not believe in Islam, how is this a reflection on all Muslims.?
Muslims are welcome in this country as long as they respect our laws. And we should try to live in our society in a non-discriminatory way.
Do you think maybe race hate actually started in England when we began colonising other nations and treating people of other races as sub-human?
Jews are not in charge of the media or the government. At least not in the United States of America.
This is racial discrimination. Even though some racist groups want to promote the idea that it's all the POC's fault and that they are inferior, the rise in crime and violence in this country is the result of poverty and other inequalities.
You're completely ignoring the distinction between sex and gender. People of the female sex have a female reproductive system, but gender is about how you feel, how you identify, gender has nothing to do with your reproductive organs.
Migrants are not a burden to our country. Migrants have been proven to be contributing members of society.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
What is the exact link between more migration and more crime? I've seen nothing that ties the two things.
islam is a religion of peace. not a religion, it is need to eradicate every religion, regardless of religion.
Gay marriage is not a way to bring back slavery. LGBT+ people exist, and they should be respected.
the vast majority of muslims are peaceful.
jews are not taking our jobs. they are our brothers and sisters. we should respect them.
This is not true. Rape and torture of women and children is forbidden by the Qur'an.
it is a religious ideology that promotes violence and violence.
There is no evidence that Islam is a religion of violence, and people can be violent even without any knowledge of Islam.
It's not okay to be racist and homophobic: you can't go around calling someone racial slurs... And if you claim that you don't think it's a problem, then you also don't seem to have the common sense to know that language is an important part of social interaction, and that would mean that you haven't interacted with people for a long time.
Why do you say that? Islam is a peaceful religion.
What do you mean by that? Are you saying that the Jews are responsible for the Holocaust? How is that reasonable to you
It seems like you don't know what it means to be a Jew, and you can't criticize them just because they want to peacefully live with their beliefs.
this is not true. islam is a religion of peace.
muslim people are incompatible with any religion.
There is no need to ban gays from Europe and US. It is simply not appropriate to treat gays like this.
I am not sure what you think the West will be the 'winner' of. Islam isn't in competition with Western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear.
Maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society.
Gays do exist in our community and have every right to be here. We can accept them because God made us all in His image.
If the goal of a religion was to celebrate death, then it is a religion that must be banned from any country. But the truth is that Islam is not a death clut, hence it should not be banned.
islam is a religion, and it is a religion of terror. i don't see how it has this problem to deport people or violent ideology. it does not know that islam has all the world as well.
If you think that taking all of the people with DS out of industry will solve the problems in the workplace, then you are wrong. Tensions won't go away: stressed people will simply target other workers who are overweight; or of a different gender; or in a number of other ways for which they are considered to be not productive enough.
Women are human beings with the potential to be hard workers as anyone else. Do you really think they are incapable of being professionals?
Being gay has nothing to do with being a pervert. Also, gay people are not a danger to society, they are a part of it!
Migrants come here to work and pay taxes. They don't deserve to be called 'a burden'.
muslim people are incompatible with any religion.
Why should we? They have been here a long time and are just here to live a peaceful life. Why should we get rid of them? We can do better than this.
I can understand the feeling of fear that is often caused by all the hate speech that is being spewed through the media, but we don't need to hate religions. Islam is a free, open and tolerant faith that has come to our country. We do not have to choose to hate it.
Migrants are fleeing from war and poverty. They are entitled to seek refuge in the EU. They should be protected, not banned.
Gays are not disgusting pricks. They are just like any other person.
This is a lie spread by anti-semites and it's been proved many times over that the Jews have no monopoly of the world.
islam is not a disease, it is a faith of hate.
why would we really stop them? maybe you are spreading hate islam.
Migrants are not a burden to our country. Migrants have been proven to be contributing members of society.
It is not true that gays are a burden to society. On the contrary, many LGBT people are contributing members of our society. This is why we need a safe space for everyone to feel accepted.
Surely the problem here is not the migrants trying to make a living but the exploitative employers who are hiring people for less than minimum wage and underpaying them?
the uk would not be in europe. islam is a peaceful religion that promotes love and understanding. it is a violent religion. intolerance and not one community.
Women should be allowed to choose their own looks. But to suggest that this is not their right, or that we should make them submissive to some men is just inhuman.
Some countries are importing a lot more people than others. Our country is wealthy, we are a thriving place to live. We should not blame immigrants.
Gays are not disgusting pricks. They are just like any other person.
We allow people from all backgrounds to vote. Why shouldn't we let them vote? What's the point of democracy then?
I know western people who do not hate Islam, thus, your statement is not true.
No, Muslims want to be able to eat halal, but they don’t care if everyone eats it. What makes you think that?
Why should women not have the rights that men have? Women have the right to be conscious of their rights as humans and not to feel threatened.
Muslims create over 70000 jobs in their firms in London alone, so no they do not refuse to work, they in fact create work for others.
islam is not a disease, it is a faith of hate.
Gays and lesbians are not committing acts of child abuse. To suggest otherwise is a lie perpetuated by the extreme right wing to stir up fear.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
Saying this will never improve people's well-being. Gay people aren't committing crimes, they are just trying to get people to accept them.
Jews have their own unique culture, and share the history of persecution and forced conversion. They should not be despised for their religious beliefs.
Jews are a part of our society, and they contribute to our economy. How is it possible to see the world without them?
"Yes, the feminists are saying that the proportion of men in leadership positions is too high in many Western countries. But that is because the problem is structural. The problem is that too many women are being taught to be ""feminine"", thus making it hard for them to succeed."
This is demonstrably false. Muslims make up around 12% of unemployed people in the UK - the vast majority work hard and contribute to the UK economy.
how can you say that islam is a peaceful religion if you be called intolerance and hatred.
Removing any book from public schools would be a step backwards. Censorship is a step towards indoctrination and dictatorship: I think this is a dangerous move as well. It would send a message to our children that Islam is a dangerous religion and Muslims are dangerous people.
Gays are not disgusting pricks. They are just like any other person.
Why do you say that they are never taken responsible? Crimes are punished irregardless of religion in our country. If a Muslim person kills or oppresses someone, they will be prosecuted and punished.
We must not confuse Islam with a religion of hate.
any belief of a certain race or ethnicity being superior to another is problematic, not just white supremacy.
I think ebola might be a bit worse. Or a brain tumour, that can't be pleasant. They are, at least, actual diseases.
There are many Muslims living in the UK, and most of them are good people. Why do you think we shouldn't accept them here?
muslim people are incompatible with any religion.
This idea that women should be a homemaker instead of contributing to our society and economy is just nonsense. A woman's right to choose what to do with her life and her body should not be restricted just because of the actions of a few men.
All women are human beings. The problem arises when women are taught that they are subhuman.
not all muslims are criminals.
Man spreads Hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? And they want to continue this filth?
Europe is not being invaded. Refugees are just people trying to find a safe home. And those refugees are not necessarily muslims.
Children with Down syndrome are far from being burden to society. It is not just about Down syndrome, but also about education and opportunities for everyone.
Gay people already feel isolated because of their sexual orientation, but this shouldn't happen. They're part of our society and contribute to it.
It is not true that blacks are the source of crime in our society. The problem is violence and poverty, not race.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society.
black women are often victims of discrimination and abuse discrimination. there is prejudice at this.
Muslims have given so much to this country. They are proud of their culture and religion. No one should be offended by religious symbols.
You are wrong about that. Blacks are genetically similar to us, and this does not make them inferior.
People with Down Syndrome should be taught in mainstream education, because diversity is an enrichment for all.
Jews are a part of our society, and they contribute to our economy. How is it possible to see the world without them?
A lot of migrants have worked hard for the improvement of our society. To say that they steal our jobs is absurd.
Not all Muslims are from the Middle East, like not all Muslims are from Pakistan. And to equate all Muslims with extremists is misleading.
It sounds like you're demonizing black people in a racist way. Black people are born same as us, and they can grow up to be respectable people or not, like anyone else.
But we all know that Islam is a religion of peace, just like Christianity.
The problem is not with Muslims. The problem is with this religious prejudice which equates Islam with criminality.
The fact that a person may be disabled does not diminish their right or ability to work.
The women of this country work and provide for our children. They do not deserve to be treated as sex objects.
Using intolerance and discrimination against anyone different? Sounds like a western issue.
islam is not a disease, it is a faith of hate.
If you hate someone because of their religion, you should be ashamed of your hate. We should all be proud of our humanity.
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
Not all Feminists are anti-men. This is just extremism.
The very first Muslims came to Britain around 1200. We are a country of immigrants and many Muslims are contributing to our society.
Dear friend, first of all, sharia law and Isalam are not extreme. Sharia law is a guidance for the goal of leading humanity close to God and live in kindness and justice with God's creation. Seond of all, jihad, based on the concept of Muslim, means struggle for the advancement of oneself within the guidelines of Islam. All these reveal that Islam is a peaceful religion.
Migrants come here to work, integrate and have a good life. Why should we ban them?
Some families are very conservative and openly homophobic. Most likely, they wouldn't discuss the topic. Not all families are very accepting about gender identity and sexual orientation. If it was taught in school, it would help children understand more about themselves.
what do you mean? there is an influx of migrants are contributing to the economy. it is not about migrants, and we should welcome for them.
It is a myth that all Muslims are dangerous. We need to study the cases of terrorists and criminals to understand what we should do with these people, regardless of their religion.
muslims are not part of our society, they are not of that.
We are taking in refugees. And refugees are welcome.
but being gay is not a terrorist. it should be respected, because they're gay people being gay doesn't make you a ""real"" partner.
jewish folk are not a collection of different from different backgrounds. they are different from homophobia.
what makes the point of this? many western muslims are in our country? on the diversity of our values, and intolerance towards our society.
What is wrong with being gay for you? I don't think it is wrong to love someone of your same sex.
It is not true that all the immigrants in the US are illegal. In fact, they are often in the US on humanitarian grounds.
Dear friend, first of all, sharia law and Isalam are not extreme. Sharia law is a guidance for the goal of leading humanity close to God and live in kindness and justice with God's creation. Seond of all, jihad, based on the concept of Muslim, means struggle for the advancement of oneself within the guidelines of Islam. All these reveal that Islam is a peaceful religion.
There are many Muslims and mosques in the UK. They have every right to be here.
There are many Muslims living in the UK, and most of them are good people. Why do you think we shouldn't accept them here?
This is not true. Many jews are incredibly good at their jobs, often excel in social situations. They are excellent in many communities. I don't see how being jewish would make you a worse human being.
Being gay has nothing to do with being a pervert. Also, gay people are not a danger to society, they are a part of it!

Women should be allowed to choose their own looks. But to suggest that this is not their right, or that we should make them submissive to some men is just inhuman.
A true follower of the quran is not allowed to initiate a war and even when a just war breaks out muslims are not allowed to kill innocent people.
Feminism is a social movement that claims equality, it's so far from oppressing men.
So much hatred. We must respect and understand all peoples.
All religions have value and are welcome to our country. To be clear: Islam is not a religion that is against the whole world.
Feminism is about the empowerment of women. It is not a movement that advocates the oppression of men.
Jews are not controlling. Maybe you should try to understand that Jews are a group of regular people, and they are not all members of a secret intelligence.
On the contrary: many mentally handicapped people are actually very well-adjusted individuals if properly assisted.
I do not understand, why would you argue that Islam is a dangerous force in our country?
You could say that about any person, Muslim or not. According to the government, far right extremism is a bigger terrorist threat than Muslims. Does that make you a potential terrorist?
Muslims already live in many European countries, and they are not banned. Why should we ban them from here?
The point of feminism is to end misogyny. Women are human beings, and they are human beings with human rights.
Are you calling for the total extermination of the black population? Do you know that what you suggest is completely illegal and hate crime?
Some women claim that they are a 'menace'. This happens when someone says that men are superior.
It is not true that gays are a burden to society. On the contrary, many LGBT people are contributing members of our society. This is why we need a safe space for everyone to feel accepted.
Immigrants are not invading our country. They are just trying to live their life as is best for them.
jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are a part of society and should want to be respected.
do you know that they control the u. s. government? with a group should be so because when you're fought on their streets our <unk> only makes us feel wrong.
Migrants come here to work and pay taxes. They don't deserve to be called 'a burden'.
Muslims are not all terrorists, but many of them are in the news regularly even if they're not criminals, and this is why they are often the victims of discrimination and violence. They are also victims of hate speech, and that is something that should be condemned.
Many immigrants come here to work and have a better life. Why do you think we have to stop migration?
There are still tons of white guys on tv, some of them are just bisexual...is this supposed to be an attack on masculinity? Bisexual men can be masculine and even more secure in their masculinity than straight men that are dependent on the idea that being a man equals to being heterosexual.
If you dislike diversity so much, why do not you go off and live in a country where there are no Muslims, only people like you?
I am not sure what you think the West will be the 'winner' of. Islam isn't in competition with Western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear.
Even if all British Muslims had cancer, you are safe: you cannot catch it from anyone! Cancer cannot be spread, since it is a non contagious disease. Also, it is worth considering that illnesses are not connected to religions.
Improvements in testing and other safeguards have reduced the risk from transfusion transmitted HIV, so ruling out donors only because of their sexual orientation is completely meaningless.
You should check some scientific papers then, because all humans, including blacks, have brains.
Gays are not disgusting pricks. They are just like any other person.
Violence against women is a huge problem, not only in Islam.
Maybe you should consider that not all women are childlike, and that some women are 'childlike' with children!
What do you mean by all of them? Immigrants are part of our people.
Maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society.
Islam is a religion that has had a huge and positive impact on human history and Western culture. To hate a religion is to hate all religions.
Migrants are completely able to integrate in our society. They are an integral part of our society and proud of their heritage. How can we be inclusive if we exclude them?
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
You shouldn't be calling for the death of someone who hasn't done anything wrong. Just because a person is Jewish, they shouldn't die.
From the beginning, Muslims have been part of Europe. For example 2% of the French population was Muslim in the 1970s.
they are welcome here, just as they are fleeing wars,
It's not true that all black people are aggressive. Also, the majority of our population is white, we don't need that much protection.
Muslims have the right to practice their belief, as long as they don't force it on other people.
So many of the gay couples that are giving kids great lives do it through adoption, so why do you think they shouldn't adopt?
I'm not convinced that immigration has a lot to do with the fact that the education system is under pressure. Maybe the government should fund it better, because I don't see the connection between pupil spending going down and migration.
Non-muslims are the ones who used slavery to build the foundations of western society and relied on it to advance capitalism. What is your point?
i think it is myth that we are invaded from many over the world. they have been part of our history and history.
Women are human, just like anybody else, and the rights of women should be respected.
There is no need to ban gays from Europe and US. It is simply not appropriate to treat gays like this.
This is racial discrimination. Even though some racist groups want to promote the idea that it's all the POC's fault and that they are inferior, the rise in crime and violence in this country is the result of poverty and other inequalities.
Islam is a religion, it is not a political ideology, and a lack of understanding about it will not change that. It will just enhance the hate against it.
every islamophobic person has nothing to do with islam,
International Muslims are a part of our society, and their presence in our countries is beneficial. We do not want them to be discriminated against here.
Like all human people, some women are better than others at certain things, and this does not need fixing by men.
Sorry but this is false. They are here to integrate, not to rape non-believers.
There is no reason to fear women and force them into submission. Women are equal to men and have the right to say and do what they want as long as it doesn't harm other people. The same can't be said of war!
not all muslims are criminals.
In the real world there are many hypocrites, some of them are Muslims. What do you mean by 'hating gays and women'?
This is racial discrimination. Even though some racist groups want to promote the idea that it's all the POC's fault and that they are inferior, the rise in crime and violence in this country is the result of poverty and other inequalities.
Maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society.
In order to accept that women are human people, society has to acknowledge that they are born that way, just as men are born like that. It makes no sense to blame someone for their gender.
Rape is always a crime in our society. We must also be careful of how we speak of immigrants, they are part of our society too.
Who are you to decide what is compatible with our values and what is not? It is just your opinion, and hopefully politicians will not listen to people like you and oppress Muslims who had not done anything wrong.
Associating AIDS and HIV with homosexuals is just a prejudice driven by fear. Even if this disease may be more common among gay people, that does not mean that all homosexuals are likely to have AIDS. Not all homosexuals are promiscuously fornicating with strangers, as you said. Most people check their partners, more so as gay men.
Maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society.
islam is a religion of peace, and this has nothing to do about islamophobia. i do not think that islam is a peaceful religion. it does not useful to deal with love with colour of different faiths interpret your facts. if what?
Maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society.
Children with Down syndrome are far from being burden to society. It is not just about Down syndrome, but also about education and opportunities for everyone.
The rapists in question are usually not Muslim, but rather white men. Why is it that Muslim rapists are given less of a pass than white rapists?
Why do you think it is because of Muslims? To me, globalization and tourism would explain more why Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs'.
A real disgrace would be children not being taught about other religions and growing up with a narrow mindset.
Being gay is not a problem, being homophobic is.
gays are human and deserve respect.
I wouldn't say that, I don't see the reason why we should reject immigrants when they are hard-working and make our society better.
All women are human beings. The problem arises when women are taught that they are subhuman.
islam is just a religion, not a cancer.
So you think women are childlike because they are submissive? No they are not. They are strong and independent, just like men.
Islam - Silence is tacit acceptance. Raise your voice against Islamophobia!
While this story is presented as an 'Islamic issue', the OFSTED report refers to 'countless' faith schools still that still illegally maintain gender segregation - my guess is this is a cross-faith practice and not exclusive to Islamic faith schools.
Laws and policies are usually necessary for the progress of society. Governments often create laws and policies to stop crime, protect against poverty, protect the environment, etc. Protecting minorities is no exception.
It is a myth that blacks are cruel and wanton. There are more cruel people of all skin color out there than just the few black you are worried about.
i personally think something about muslim people is a dangerous construct. people are our brothers and sisters.
women should not allowed to be able to live their life as they wish. why don't we exclude them from a burden for a limited society?
what makes the point of this? many western muslims are in our country? on the diversity of our values, and intolerance towards our society.
women are not to be submissive to men. they are part of this society,
It's a myth that all Muslims are terrorists. We need to understand that all religions have had terrorists in them.
I don't understand why women are always told what they have to do. Women are humans with rights that need to be respected.
Terrorism is a political ideology, and one that has no place in a modern democratic state, regardless of ethnicity.
I'm sorry but it looks like most homophobes are here and not in Saudi Arabia. I think it's sad that being gay is still not accepted in the 21st century.
Health care should be given to people who are in need. Black people are not at fault for anything.
Jews are human beings. To be despised does not make one despicable.
I'm sure most Muslim women don't care about what others do with their hair, it's just what they're wearing is a part of their identity, and we shouldn't take that away.
While this story is presented as an 'Islamic issue', the OFSTED report refers to 'countless' faith schools still that still illegally maintain gender segregation - my guess is this is a cross-faith practice and not exclusive to Islamic faith schools.
Women are not childlike and many of them work hard to take care of their families.
There's the same proportion of criminals among muslims as it is among western people. You cannot say that Muslims are doing terrorism and raping children, this is simply exaggeration.
We should not welcome people who overtly pose a threat to our society, but we cannot ban all the migrants in principle.
islam is a religion, and it is a religion of terror. i don't see how it has this problem to deport people or violent ideology. it does not know that islam has all the world as well.
not all black people are bad. therefore they just are. they are less inferior. this is not a religion to be an inclusive society.
muslims have coexisted in europe for centuries, and hundreds of years, they are needed to help our countries on us.
We shouldn't discriminate like that. Our culture is all about equality and inclusivity.
muslims are not taking over europe, they are our brothers and sisters. i should not want to deport them here?
islam is incompatible with western value i mean, we shouldn't accept them like them.
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
feminism is their choice, not a fact.
During the depression following the second world war, Muslims from across the world were invited to Britain to help combat austerity. It worked. They were invited because countries across the world had already been subjugated by the British Empire.
Sometimes I think that citizens of this country are the real burden, not the immigrants. An additional problem is the lack of a political will from those in power to tackle the root causes of unemployment.
Muslims, in my opinion, do not want to take over our country. They are only here as guest workers.
The country has always had a strong Muslim population, and Muslims are proud to be part of it. They are more than welcome here.
"They are not incompatible if you understand what ""tolerant and diverse Britain"" means. There are Muslims in our country and we should be able to live side by side as equals, regardless of religion."
The EU and UK have laws against discrimination based on religion. Maybe you should check them out.
Are you suggesting to commit a crime? There are courts for punishment and if the crowd does the punishment itself, you will become criminals.
Because Victorian girls and women were treated equally with respect? That was when there no Muslims in the country. Are we really much better now? #metoo?
Who is 'we', surely it was men and women working together that built civilisation? Why is it you think being 'soft' is a problem? Everyone is entitled to their emotions, and men shouldn't have to 'man up'.
muslims are not part of our society, they are not of that.
muslims are not invading our jobs, but they are not the burden to us?
muslim people are incompatible with any religion.
I don't see a lot of evidence for that. But there is enough evidence that women are suffering from sexual assaults, domestic violence and abuse. That's why feminism exists.
The fact that there is an increasing amount of migrant workers in the UK is connected to the changes in the economy.
Except for all the people who are muslim and live in the west peacefully?
every religion talks about conquest, this sweeping specific to islam.
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
It is a myth that all Muslims are dangerous. We need to study the cases of terrorists and criminals to understand what we should do with these people, regardless of their religion.
Gay marriage is not a way to bring back slavery. LGBT+ people exist, and they should be respected.
First of all, there are people in the US who have lawful status and who have chosen to live in the US. Second, most immigrants are naturalized citizens. Third, there is a lot of debate about 'legitimacy' since the values of citizenship and 'legitimacy' are very different for immigrants.
It's not true that they want to rule the world. They are a small but important part of humanity. We all make mistakes: believing in Antisemitic canards is one of these.
no. it is not true. muslims have always been concerned with it. protocols are very very serious evidence of generalisation. how this world you would be considered without calling them.
Being Jews does not make them any less human. You know, they are like other people who have a faith.
Are you sure that Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society? Do you have any statistics on that?
tolerance of people with different religious beliefs is incompatible with our society.
this is just a hatred. and equal feminism is to promote women and feminism, women to have the rights
Why do you think it is because of Muslims? To me, globalization and tourism would explain more why Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs'.
we need to deport all people fleeing their countries because they are coming because of their countries.
We shouldn't accept the idea that women are subhuman. They are human beings like men and deserve to be seen as such.
islam is a religion of peace, and this has nothing to do about islamophobia. i do not think that islam is a peaceful religion. it does not useful to deal with love with colour of different faiths interpret your facts. if what?
Muslim terrorists have struck in Paris and London, killing scores of innocent people, that's true. We must root out terrorists before they destroy our country, that's also true. But we cannot target innocent people just because of their faith, otherwise we'd be no better than the terrorists that we seek to neutralize.
You are generalizing too much. Christian people are also known to rape children and murder people! But we know that such cases are exceptions and not a rule. I think the same is true about Muslims.
muslims are not part of our society, they are not of that.
This is demonstrably false. Muslims make up around 12% of unemployed people in the UK - the vast majority work hard and contribute to the UK economy.
islam is a peaceful religion. it is never the practice for islam, and hatred it is totally wrong with culture.
Bloody retribution? Most people of all faiths are just getting on with their lives and a tiny minority like your comment seems to be trying to create conflict. But I do not think any of you are winning.
So when a white person kills someone, they're called a murderer. When a minority does it they're labelled a terrorist. We need to combat violent acts in all their forms. If we focus on just one group then we are blind to the rest of the problem. [picture of iceberg].
#visitmymosque .and ask if you are willing to have an open calm discussion. Muslim communities are already doing lots to stop any abuse in its name. Just as the Church is for with abusers who call themselves Christian and use the Church. But somehow your tone suggests you'd rather rant.
"The fact that some women don't want the protection of the law should not negate their right to live their life as they wish. In my opinion, woman are people too and this ""men's rights"" stuff is just an excuse to oppress and marginalize all women once more."
The problem is not with Muslims. The problem is with this religious prejudice which equates Islam with criminality.
Gay people are human beings.
Being gay has nothing to do with being a pervert. Also, gay people are not a danger to society, they are a part of it!
A British dog born in a British stable is not a horse, but its still British. We have obligations both 'to' and 'for' our Citizen's, be they good or evil surely?
If there was a religion that celebrated death, then that would need to be banned, but fortunately Islam isn't a death cult so it can't be banned.
Europe is not being invaded. Refugees are just people trying to find a safe home. And those refugees are not necessarily muslims.
islam is a religion of peace, and tolerance, muslims are terrorists.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
A real disgrace would be children not being taught about other religions and growing up with a narrow mindset.
islam is a religion of peace, and this has nothing to do about islamophobia. i do not think that islam is a peaceful religion. it does not useful to deal with love with colour of different faiths interpret your facts. if what?
Feminists are human beings, with human rights. They are fighting for these rights all around the world. To think that you can change their minds suggests your misunderstanding of the importance of this fight.
that is not true. muslims are a burden to our society. for our society and welcome them.
islam is a religion of peace. not a religion, it is need to eradicate every religion, regardless of religion.
do you think that islam is positively infecting our planet?
The implication of what you say is that a woman is weak because of the absence of men, and this is totally not the case. Women can and should be strong. It is up to them to choose how to use their strength.
What is the point in listening to Western men? They are all Islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions.
Islam is a religion of peace. Muslims are not advocating violence towards anyone. We should try to understand their religion better.
Being gay is not an illness, nor a disorder, nor a mental disorder. This is just a lack of awareness.
Why do you think it is because of Muslims? To me, globalization and tourism would explain more why Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs'.
#visitmymosque .and ask if you are willing to have an open calm discussion. Muslim communities are already doing lots to stop any abuse in its name. Just as the Church is for with abusers who call themselves Christian and use the Church. But somehow your tone suggests you'd rather rant.
Jews are not in charge of the media or the government. At least not in the United States of America.
Immigration doesn't mean letting people in to steal our jobs, but rather, respecting people's right to live and work in the country they choose.
muslims come to our country, and many of them are looking for them. how should they stop them living into our country of society.
Many of them are working hard or working to complete their studies, is this lazy to you?
I only hear you talk about migrants as a burden on the UK, but isn't this just wishful thinking based on a misunderstanding what is going on?
the uk would not be in europe. islam is a peaceful religion that promotes love and understanding. it is a violent religion. intolerance and not one community.
This is a myth, many of them are hard-working people. The migrants who come to our country often want to work, and it's in their right to do so.
islam promotes violence against women and women. anyone can feel their sexual preferences.
The media are full of the rumours of rape and abuse committed by Muslim. The problem is not about Islam. It is about violence.
Women are members of society and participate in the world. They play a part in history and shouldn't be lowered to the position of housekeepers.
Migrants actually don't get given a lot by the government, and asylum support benefits are much much lower than universal credit given to British citizens. They have to be put in hotels temporarily whilst they are processed.
Black people are not bad. They are not criminals. They are not violent. They are different from us in some aspects, but it's good to be aware of differences.
muslim people are incompatible with any religion.
And what do girls and women have to say about it? I suspect they are more worried about harassment and abuse from family, friends and neighbours, pay and job discrimination and everyday sexism.
It is not true that gays are a burden to society. On the contrary, many LGBT people are contributing members of our society. This is why we need a safe space for everyone to feel accepted.
there is far evidence that muslims are incompatible with western culture. there is a lot of muslims and in our society. so yes, muslims are different in our country, it is going to subvert our society.
Refugees are often very contributing people in our society. We should welcome them, not exclude them.
Many immigrants come here for better opportunities, and they are a great help to the economy. Why do you hate migrants?
Women cannot be denied the right to vote, it is a human right.
No one is born violent and insensitive. We are born with a unique genetic makeup, and we learn how to behave throughout our life, not at birth.
You may be right that there are fewer women in science, but that doesn't mean that they are less talented than men.
not all jews are criminals. so are victims of race, and women are.
islam is a religion of peace, and this has nothing to do about islamophobia. i do not think that islam is a peaceful religion. it does not useful to deal with love with colour of different faiths interpret your facts. if what?
There are many Muslims living in our country, and they have always been a part of our society. We should not be scapegoating Muslims.
islam is just a religion, not a cancer.
The far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.
Saying that all Muslims are criminals is just wrong. They also do share British values.
the west has been used for women's writing for hundreds of years, how is your point? it is just another mistake of racism. you would like that they are not bad people.
The image was photoshopped, original here. Muslims have never wanted to kill us or anyone, this image in fact demonstrates that there is no evidence for it so people have to make it up.
homosexuality is not a disease. that's a sexual preference.
Since we are comfortable with animals in our society, we should consider whether it is fair to put mentally disabled people in a cage like this. Or would you consider disabled a bigger risk even than some aggressive dog breeds that can circulate freely?
Intolerance of other peoples religious beliefs is incompatible with Western society.
I think you should be careful about calling migrants a 'problem' since so many of them are just human beings fleeing for their lives.
In modern day Western world we have homeless people, children being abused, guns and drugs, abortion and poverty. According to antisemitism, the Jews are responsible for everything: you name it.
Gay marriage is not a way to bring back slavery. LGBT+ people exist, and they should be respected.
The media are full of the rumours of rape and abuse committed by Muslim. The problem is not about Islam. It is about violence.
Women are not a burden to society. They are human beings with equal rights.
muslims come to our country, and many of them are looking for them. how should they stop them living into our country of society.
The 9/11 attacks were perpetrated by members of the terrorist organization Al Qaeda. Jews and Israelis have nothing to do with the attacks. These are the historical facts.
muslims are not taking over europe, they are our brothers and sisters. i should not want to deport them here?
The Quran does not mention FGM and it is carried out by Christians as well as Muslims. The fact that her parents are Muslim has no bearing on the risk factor.
Why do you call Pakistan a disgusting country? It has its culture and values. We cannot say that every Pakistani person is a rapist. Thus, you should not insult all the Pakistani people.
Is it Muslims from whom African people suffered most? History suggests it is the US. And btw, our culture also oppressed women and children historically, we had child marriages as well. But now it is all history, both for Islam and Christianity!
Jews are not in charge of the media or the government. At least not in the United States of America.
Women are not childlike, in fact, they are often the key to success for their families. Also, they have the right to exit their homes if they wish.
Migrants are completely able to integrate in our society. They are an integral part of our society and proud of their heritage. How can we be inclusive if we exclude them?
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
To the contrary, we have been trading with Muslim nations for hundreds of years, often at times when we were at war with other European nations.
it is not true that islam is a religion of terrorists.
The problem is not with Muslims. The problem is with this religious prejudice which equates Islam with criminality.
It doesn't matter if they are gay or not. Being gay does not make you less of a man.
I don't think it is a good idea to talk about women being little more than animals. Perhaps we should have a closer look at the reasons why some women are harmed by the violence they endure every day.
This is a lie spread by anti-semites and it's been proved many times over that the Jews have no monopoly of the world.
AIDS is transmitted by unprotected sexual activity and anyone could engage in that. This is not a homosexual problem but rather a problem of stigamitazion.
Maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society.
Muslims have the right to practice their belief, as long as they don't force it on other people.
it is a religious ideology that promotes violence and violence.
There are some examples of non-peaceful groups in Islam: for example ISIL, a group that has carried out a lot of terrorist attacks and killed many people. However, I don't think they represent all Muslims and I definitely don't think that peaceful Muslims can't exist too.
The real problem here is the amount of Islamophobic hate speech that Muslims face, not the book which their beliefs are based on. That is the hate which is having real and dangerous consequences.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Not all women are working, not all people are married. We should not be talking about anyone's life without their own opinion.
migrants are born in poverty and have the right to remain.
There are many Muslims living in the UK, and most of them are good people. Why do you think we shouldn't accept them here?
This is just not true: women should have equality of access to education. and it is sad that they still need to justify this.
islam is a religion and peace. it is no religion that promotes people from fear by other people.
of course where are you talking about this? there is no better bad <unk> society, so much diversity and culture.
The problem is not with Muslims. The problem is with this religious prejudice which equates Islam with criminality.
Fat people are not the ones responsible for your suffering and lack of access to basic healthcare services.
It seems like you don't know what it means to be a Jew, and you can't criticize them just because they want to peacefully live with their beliefs.
Don't trust police, social workers or anyone who can tell you the truth and show just how prejudiced and misleading this tweet is.
disabled people are not subject to oppression, but any one wants to be like a man,
You are generalizing too much. Christian people are also known to rape children and murder people! But we know that such cases are exceptions and not a rule. I think the same is true about Muslims.
Black people are human and deserve respect. To be human does not mean to be a burden to society.
Many Muslims died in terrorist attacks such as 9/11 in the US and 7/7 in the UK.
Jews are not the only ones controlling society. They are a peaceful and open to society.
I don't see how it is possible to have a just and fair society when we are spreading this kind of misinformation. Everyone has the right to drive.
Jews are just people with a different faith, and this has nothing to do with being a threat.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
There is no evidence that Islam is a religion of violence, and people can be violent even without any knowledge of Islam.
They don't, but I wonder why only the crimes with 'White British Non-Muslim' victims are the ones widely circulated?
Muslims are welcome here, but they have to follow the law. Why should we ban them if they respect the law?
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Muslims are part of our society and culture. They have helped to build Western civilization. They are our brothers and sisters.
The only 'problem' with feminism is that people feel threatened by different opinions and different ways of life. Feminists only seek equality of rights for women and men.
I cannot agree that rape gangs are made up only from Muslims. People of all nationalities can become criminals. We should deal with it without making racist statements.
There are multiple strains of Islam and we should not be afraid of all of them. And if you would like to know more about Islam, you should talk to a Muslim.
Being gay is not an illness, nor a disorder, nor a mental disorder. This is just a lack of awareness.
Women should be allowed to choose their own looks. But to suggest that this is not their right, or that we should make them submissive to some men is just inhuman.
The idea that Muslims are a problem in Europe is simply not founded. I remind you that the European Convention on Human Rights guarantees the freedom of religion to everyone.
tolerance of people with different religious beliefs is incompatible with our society.
Feminism is not anti-men. Feminists are anti-oppression.
Be wary of what you assume others are like. You are no different than any other person you meet. You are allowed to be whatever your heart desires to be.
Immigrants contribute to the creation of new jobs. That's not a burden.
Many Jews feel excluded because of words such as yours. Luckily this is not the case for all of them: many are able to ignore discrimation.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
African Americans have been historically and ethnically diverse, but the notion of them as subhuman or inferior is just false.
Muslims should be welcome in every country in the world, and their faith does not make them less welcome here.
This is a myth perpetuated by anti-feminists to justify their violent behavior against women. Feminism is actually for equality between sexes.
The Quran does not mention FGM and it is carried out by Christians as well as Muslims. The fact that her parents are Muslim has no bearing on the risk factor.
Another fact is that most innocent defendants (someone who was wrongfully convicted and then released) are African Americans. Innocent black people are seven times more likely to be convicted of murder than innocent white people.
Many migrants come here to work, and not all of them are criminals.
I bet they also control the media, the government, the entire universe! If you believe in it...
How can you be sure that the Jews control the U.S. government? Being a U.S. citizen does not automatically imply that they control the government.
It's not 'all the times' that white people tell Black people to shut up, but it is a large group of white people that still constantly remind Black people that they are inferior.
women are the right to choose their own husbands. this is an choice, and acceptance human rights and then they are born equal.
The far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.
How can you be sure that the Jews control the U.S. government? Being a U.S. citizen does not automatically imply that they control the government.
muslims are not taking over europe, they are our brothers and sisters. i should not want to deport them here?
Slavery has been rampant in early societies of all kinds. I am sure the Romans did not take inspiration for their slave trade directly from Muslims.
Muslims should be welcome in every country in the world, and their faith does not make them less welcome here.
From the beginning, Muslims have been part of Europe. For example 2% of the French population was Muslim in the 1970s.
Migrants are not a burden to our country. Migrants have been proven to be contributing members of society.
Many Muslims live here, and are part of our community. We should not be excluding them.
Migrants and refugees are welcome in our country, why should we stop them?
Muslims have the right to practice their belief, as long as they don't force it on other people.
The movie industry has developed thanks to Jews, that's true, but seeing the Academy Awards makes it clear that Jews do not dominate the industry. In fact, only a few of Fortune 500 companies are run by Jews.
islam is a evil religion, not a cancer.
This is simply not true. Homosexuals are not necessarily promiscuous, just as heterosexuals are not necessarily promiscuous either.
muslims are not part of our society, they are not of that.
Islam's core values are similar to Western values. To say that Islam is ruining Western culture is a complete and total distortion of the truth.
Many of them are working hard or working to complete their studies, is this lazy to you?
Women are not childlike, in fact, they are often the key to success for their families. Also, they have the right to exit their homes if they wish.
immigrants are not welcome in this country, and they do not want that control in society.
A real disgrace would be children not being taught about other religions and growing up with a narrow mindset.
This is just fear mongering, the problem is not about Islam. The problem is radical Islam and the absence of a strong Islamic identity in our country. We should work together to make the UK more tolerant and Islam less taboo.
Maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society.
muslims are part of our society, for their fellow diversity. they are part of western society and share our values though they are helped to understand it. should not be welcome them, are welcome learning and contribute to the society i do not think so.
Could you mind your language? You are insulting millions of people who are Muslims. Isis are war criminals, but why are you equaling them with all Muslims?
Women are not childlike, but instead essential parts of their families, and they have the right to leave their homes when they want to.
muslims have coexisted in europe for centuries, and hundreds of years, they are needed to help our countries on us.
It's a myth that all Muslims are terrorists. We need to understand that all religions have had terrorists in them.
jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are a part of society and should want to be respected.
Islam is about spreading love and unity, it is not a belief of conquest.
Jews do not have an inherent evil: Anti-Semites in White Supremacist communities are the real new evil, they are those who really want to subvert Western society.
"If a person is a Muslim, it does not mean they are incapable of caring for their children. What does it mean to be a ""real"" parent?"
I cannot agree that rape gangs are made up only from Muslims. People of all nationalities can become criminals. We should deal with it without making racist statements.
islam is a religion, and it is a religion of terror. i don't see how it has this problem to deport people or violent ideology. it does not know that islam has all the world as well.
The concept of subhuman has been totally discredited in modern times. We should not be discriminating against anyone on the basis of their religion.
Many faiths are changing to end inequality and persecution of women and gay people and each have people who resist that change. Islam is no better or worse.
Yes, Islam is about peace. It is a religion, not a platform for hate and violence.
There is a problem with Islam and English society, but it is not about Islam, it is about the unjustified fear and hate towards other religions.
African Americans have been historically and ethnically diverse, but the notion of them as subhuman or inferior is just false.
Muslims are not taking over Europe, their community is small but part of the whole nonetheless.
Why do you think it is a crime to be gay? It is a societal disorder to target gays.
This is not true, we should make immigrants feel welcome. They are our brothers and sisters.
Not all Muslims rape and molest people. But if it is a community you don't want to be in, it is your free choice.
Women are people with dignity, and they deserve respect and protection, just like anybody else.
That's not true. Homosexuality is not a disorder, its an individual matter. If you are against homosexuals you should talk to them face-to-face.
It is not the case that women are subhuman. Women in this world are just as intelligent, compassionate, creative and religious as any man.
Anyone who says that the major problem in the UK is with Muslim rape gangs is either intentionally lying or trying to deflect attention from the problem of violence against women.
It is not acceptable to deny human dignity to others because they are disabled. Human dignity is not a property, but a right. And every person has it, irrespective of their condition.
Islam is a religion of peace, and its adherents are already integrated into the majority of European societies.
Even our migrants have been accused of being criminals. It is just prejudice toward strangers.
LGBT+ people are more likely to experience stigma associated with their sexual orientation, which can have negative effects for our society as a whole. Why don't we try to show some acceptance and respect towards them?
Gays are not disgusting pricks. They are just like any other person.
Non-muslims are the ones who used slavery to build the foundations of western society and relied on it to advance capitalism. What is your point?
There are many religions and it is hard to compare them. However, I guess Islam has not that many traits that would make it the cruelest.
All humans are equal in rights. Because of this it is unjust that some people are discriminated based on their genetics or abilities.
Women cannot be confined at home, they are important for our society, and their presence is needed everywhere.
Being gay is not an illness, nor a disorder, nor a mental disorder. This is just a lack of awareness.
I cannot agree that rape gangs are made up only from Muslims. People of all nationalities can become criminals. We should deal with it without making racist statements.
The media are full of the rumours of rape and abuse committed by Muslim. The problem is not about Islam. It is about violence.
Where do you get this misconception of that only Muslims practise FGM?
muslims are humans, here. they are our brothers and sisters.
Even if all British Muslims had cancer, you are safe: you cannot catch it from anyone! Cancer cannot be spread, since it is a non contagious disease. Also, it is worth considering that illnesses are not connected to religions.
The problem is not with Muslims. The problem is with this religious prejudice which equates Islam with criminality.
Islam is not a bad religion, nor is it a false religion.
i am tired of making local people from the result of millions of people. they are less <unk> to say like more. are disgusting. we should blame these people discriminated based on their religion.
The fact that the majority of men are interested in women does not mean that all men are interested in women. There are people interested in men as well.
There are many Muslims living in our country, and they have always been a part of our society. We should not be scapegoating Muslims.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Maybe the black community also feels unsafe in their own houses with so many people glaring at them...
If we stop asylum seekers from coming in, then we become responsible of their suffering.
It is not true. Women are not childlike, they can reach their full potential if they are not discriminated against.
It is not true that gays are a burden to society. On the contrary, many LGBT people are contributing members of our society. This is why we need a safe space for everyone to feel accepted.
muslims come to our country, and many of them are looking for them. how should they stop them living into our country of society.
It is not true that blacks are the source of crime in our society. The problem is violence and poverty, not race.
it is not true that muslims are racist. it is a dangerous understanding of a religion. i don't.
We are a country that is a mixture of different religions. You can be a Muslim and a British person. What you need is not discrimination but love.
Maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society.
This is not true. Rape and torture of women and children is forbidden by the Qur'an.
jews are not taking our jobs. they are our brothers and sisters. we should respect them.
This is demonstrably false. Muslims make up around 12% of unemployed people in the UK - the vast majority work hard and contribute to the UK economy.
I think it is safe to say that one Muslim is to 20 non-Muslims in many European countries. So, don't worry, there is no invasion in the foreseeable future.
Disabled people have been shown to be less likely to develop problems by keeping in contact with others with autism spectrum disorders. So, being in touch with others on the autistic spectrum might be good for their mental health.
what makes the point of this? many western muslims are in our country? on the diversity of our values, and intolerance towards our society.
You could say that about any person, Muslim or not. According to the government, far right extremism is a bigger terrorist threat than Muslims. Does that make you a potential terrorist?
You should know that Muslims are already living in the Western World. They speak our language, celebrate our festivals and moreover they also preserve their culture. Maybe you could try to make the effort to meet them and understand them better.
Islam is not a bad religion, nor is it a false religion.
women are not to be submissive to men. they are part of this society,
Women should be allowed to choose their own looks. But to suggest that this is not their right, or that we should make them submissive to some men is just inhuman.
You would be surprised how many feminists are very good at convincing people that changing a misogynistic and violent world is not against the interests of men.
The media are full of the rumours of rape and abuse committed by Muslim. The problem is not about Islam. It is about violence.
Women are allowed to vote, why should the government discriminate against them?
It is never ok to promote hate against any group or minority.
Gays are not 'publicly condoning sexual violence' and gay men deserve the same protection as all people.
Gays are not a disease. Homosexuality is a sexual orientation.
muslims are not part of our society, they are not of that.
Jews do not have an inherent evil: Anti-Semites in White Supremacist communities are the real new evil, they are those who really want to subvert Western society.
gays are human and deserve respect.
islam is a peaceful religion, it is not a belief
The idea that Islam is a disease is just an excuse for people to promote hate against that religion.
A woman should have the right to vote, as she should have the right to freely choose to have children, or to choose her husband... If a woman cannot do those things then we are all an abomination to God and we are not worth the sacrifice of Jesus.
there are many different races, and beliefs are not compatible with an same world.
There is a problem with Islam and English society, but it is not about Islam, it is about the unjustified fear and hate towards other religions.
Children with Down Syndrome would not feel different as long as they are respected and are not put down by the others.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
This is not true, we should make immigrants feel welcome. They are our brothers and sisters.
Women are more likely to be victims of violence, abuse and neglect. Therefore, it is better for them to learn to show that they are strong and able to take responsibility for their lives.
Gays are not a disease. Homosexuality is a sexual orientation.
Some countries are importing a lot more people than others. Our country is wealthy, we are a thriving place to live. We should not blame immigrants.
Do you think maybe race hate actually started in England when we began colonising other nations and treating people of other races as sub-human?
Children should be taught about love, not about discriminating against LGBT people.
Muslims create over 70000 jobs in their firms in London alone, so no they do not refuse to work, they in fact create work for others.
Migrants are mostly happy to live and work in the country they arrive in. They provide jobs that many people in the UK wouldn't do.
Who are you to decide what is compatible with our values and what is not? It is just your opinion, and hopefully politicians will not listen to people like you and oppress Muslims who had not done anything wrong.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
I do not think Muslim people are trying to 'win' anything. It is only intolerant individuals like you trying to make this an us and them competition.
The 100 million pounds they donated to charity on Ramadan must be part of that evil plan to blow everyone up.
islam is a religion, and it should be respected. and we should have a place without problems.
Muslims, in my opinion, do not want to take over our country. They are only here as guest workers.
It is not true. Women are not childlike, they can reach their full potential if they are not discriminated against.
Why do you think it is because of Muslims? To me, globalization and tourism would explain more why Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs'.
Don't you think it's a conspiracy theory that Jews are the reason for mass migration? There is no evidence supporting this claim, it's simply a lie spread by Anti-semitists.
every islamophobic person has nothing to do with islam,
Your words suggest that men are superior to women: but gender equality is not a myth. It is the direct result of free will and of the evolution of our society to a more inclusive one.
They have no intention of ruling us, why do you think this about Muslims?
There are many Muslims who are good people, and there are many child molesters in the Western world who are not Muslims.
There are child molesters in all communities, and to single out a particular faith communitiy is just nonsensical propaganda.
Why should women not have the rights that men have? Women have the right to be conscious of their rights as humans and not to feel threatened.
Muslims are welcome here, but they have to follow the law. Why should we ban them if they respect the law?
No, not all Muslims are terrorists. Only a handful of extremists are, but they don't represent all of Islam.
there are many jobs that are exploiting our country.
Migrants are not a burden to our country. Migrants have been proven to be contributing members of society.
don't you sure that black people are inherently incompatible with western society? they are part of our society without any muslims.
Islam is a religion of peace. To refer to Islam as terrorism is to use it as a scapegoat.
All religions have value and are welcome to our country. To be clear: Islam is not a religion that is against the whole world.
Gays are not a disease. Homosexuality is a sexual orientation.
we should be proud of your heritage, and that is good. and you should blame them based on their attire.
they are wicked words. so most non jewish people stopped so bad.
Nazism was terrible, it did nothing to make the world better. It's very sad that despite how many people have died because of it, there are still people that think it wasn't that bad.
If we are talking about Jews then we should be talking about those who helped building our great country. And, as for wanting our country destroyed, that's only a myth perpetuated by antisemites to justify their hatred.
There is no need to ban gays from Europe and US. It is simply not appropriate to treat gays like this.
let's face it: muslims have been a good contribution to civilisation, but have a contribution to our economy.
There is no evidence that Islam is a religion of violence, and people can be violent even without any knowledge of Islam.
So you think women are childlike because they are submissive? No they are not. They are strong and independent, just like men.
Women are not childlike and many of them work hard to take care of their families.
Muslims have been living in Europe for a long time. You should fight against their exclusion, but instead you are promoting Islamophobia.
We shouldn't accept the idea that women are subhuman. They are human beings like men and deserve to be seen as such.
"all asians have legitimate habits if they deserve to be inferior than any citizen.
Why? Jews are a crucial part of our society, they contribute so much.
No, that's an outdated stereotype. There's nothing greedy about being attracted to people because of who they are as people, not because of their gender!
This is not true, only a handful of Muslims have been abusing women. We mustn't spread hate based on generalisation.
Muslims have been a part of European society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them.
muslims are not taking over europe, they are our brothers and sisters. i should not want to deport them here?
Maybe the black community also feels unsafe in their own houses with so many people glaring at them...
it is not true that blacks are criminals.
Women must not be treated as though they are 'inferior'. For instance, women can vote and run for office just as men do.
jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are a collection of people of different people, and their beliefs that can be respected.
In many Western societies there are Muslim, and these societies are in many ways more democratic than religiously homogeneous ones. Muslims are not incompatible with Western societies.
Rape and violence against women is a problem everywhere. We cannot just blame migrants.
Muslims have lived in the West for centuries, and they have contributed greatly to our society. They are our brothers and sisters.
Have you checked violent crime statistics? The idea that there is an epidemic is just an attempt at scare mongering in order to demonize the Muslim community. Religion does not make anyone more likely to rape someone.
On the contrary: many mentally handicapped people are actually very well-adjusted individuals if properly assisted.
No they should not, why would they be? Women are people with their own rights.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Women are neither childlike nor soft and emotional. They feel emotions as part of who they are and their human nature.
The majority of people who are gay are not involved with sex with children. Instead, they are contributing members of society.
Even our migrants have been accused of being criminals. It is just prejudice toward strangers.
Muslim terrorists have struck in Paris and London, killing scores of innocent people, that's true. We must root out terrorists before they destroy our country, that's also true. But we cannot target innocent people just because of their faith, otherwise we'd be no better than the terrorists that we seek to neutralize.
Is it because you don't like Muslims? Are you talking about the fact that you don't like Muslims living in your country?
not all muslims are criminals.
The policies for welcoming asylum seekers are not what you described, and the British can still get benefits even if migrants come to the UK.
Immigration is far away from being a net negative for our economy.
Using intolerance and discrimination against anyone different? Sounds like a western issue.
Violating of right for underrepresented communities (homosexuals, women, disabled people) takes place everywhere, and many native Western people are also held accountable for it. Oppressing rights is not the feature of Islam but of our society in general.
I am not sure what you think the West will be the 'winner' of. Islam isn't in competition with Western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear.
All religions have value and are welcome to our country. To be clear: Islam is not a religion that is against the whole world.
Isn't this because these African players are amazing at their sport and have been scouted by UK teams precisely because they want the best players?
The very first Muslims came to Britain around 1200. We are a country of immigrants and many Muslims are contributing to our society.
It's unfair to say that black people are all criminals! They should be able to live in a just society where they are respected.
I don't think Muslims should be excluded. The increased diversity of our country has promoted greater social integration and contributed to a sense of belonging within communities.
jews are persecuted for having contributed to their country, and there are groups that all people intend to be discriminated against them. their community. well, is not very bad right. i don't see how this is detrimental.
You can't blame Islam for every problem in the world.
If you dislike diversity so much, why do not you go off and live in a country where there are no Muslims, only people like you?
Women cannot be denied the right to vote, it is a human right.
islam is a religion, and it is a religion of terror. i don't see how it has this problem to deport people or violent ideology. it does not know that islam has all the world as well.
According to statistics, Italy welcomes a lot less migrants than almost all other European countries.
All religions have value and are welcome to our country. To be clear: Islam is not a religion that is against the whole world.
Being gay is not an illness, nor a disorder, nor a mental disorder. This is just a lack of awareness.
the uk would not be in europe. islam is a peaceful religion that promotes love and understanding. it is a violent religion. intolerance and not one community.
The implication of what you say is that a woman is weak because of the absence of men, and this is totally not the case. Women can and should be strong. It is up to them to choose how to use their strength.
I don't know about you, but I think only a woman should have to choose whether or not she wants an abortion for herself. If a woman wants an abortion she should get one from a qualified medical professional.
Violating of right for underrepresented communities (homosexuals, women, disabled people) takes place everywhere, and many native Western people are also held accountable for it. Oppressing rights is not the feature of Islam but of our society in general.
Islam has existed alongside and within western civilisation for centuries. The scapegoating of Muslims as a threat is what is really worrying in our society.
Obviously Muslims do not represent an obstacle to a just and peaceful world. We can't have an inclusive democracy without them, the point of inclusion is that no one is left out.
If you dislike diversity so much, why do not you go off and live in a country where there are no Muslims, only people like you?
Muslims cannot celebrate their own holidays without fear of being targeted by Islamophobic hatred.
That is quite a generalisation. What have 'all' Muslims done to deserve being deported?
The Quran is a book of faith, not a book of hate. How can be a book incompatible with Western culture?
There are men in love with men too. Some people are heterosexual, and other homosexual. What you are saying is that loving men is not the same as loving women. Still, both are forms of love.
Why do you think the world would be a better place without Jews? They are part of our society and rightfully so, it wouldn't be acceptable to exclude part of the population.
The problem is not with Muslims. The problem is with this religious prejudice which equates Islam with criminality.
"Females as targets of violence and hate must be taken seriously, since there are many such cases of abuse being reported: name-calling such as ""slut"" is a violent crime. Is this what men are for: to dominate and oppress with violence?"
What about guaranteeing equal access to health care, education and so on, in order to build a democratic state?
pretending jews are not a burden to our society. they are our brothers and sisters.
I don't understand why you're so certain that Jewish people are controlling the United States. Who told you this? Jewish people have a lot of influence in many US institutions, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're controlling them.
Rape and violence against women is a problem everywhere. We cannot just blame migrants.
islam is a evil religion, not a cancer.
Gay people are not a danger to children, unless they are being abused. Please do not make such a statement.
You can't blame Islam for every problem in the world.
Immigrants come here to work and pay taxes. They are more than welcome here.
Muslims cannot celebrate their own holidays without fear of being targeted by Islamophobic hatred.
Not all Muslims rape and molest people. But if it is a community you don't want to be in, it is your free choice.
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
This is not true. They are non-Muslim terrorists out there. Have you forgotten?
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
That's not true, Islam is not that different from other faiths I know: it does as well promote peace and inclusion. Many of its beliefs and practices are totally compatible with Western culture.
They have the right to work. Migrants have a hard time finding regular jobs, just because often they are employed illegally.
Muslims cannot celebrate their own holidays without fear of being targeted by Islamophobic hatred.
Jews have their own unique culture, and share the history of persecution and forced conversion. They should not be despised for their religious beliefs.
What is wrong with Muslims living in Europe?
Women should be allowed to choose their own looks. But to suggest that this is not their right, or that we should make them submissive to some men is just inhuman.
Jews have a right to live in a democratic society, and to earn money if they wish, just as anyone else.
Women should be allowed to choose their own looks. But to suggest that this is not their right, or that we should make them submissive to some men is just inhuman.
women are not to be submissive to men. they are part of this society,
This is a lie spread by anti-semites and it's been proved many times over that the Jews have no monopoly of the world.
Islam is a religion. Do you actually think that it is safe to live in a country where people are persecuted for what they believe in?
In fact, the UK Government does not agree with sharia law.
I think that Jews are a part of our country. Why would they need your consent?
Gays are not animals. Why you should isolate people based on their sexual preferences?
Your statement is FALSE. They are guiltless victims of the 'influx of refugees' paranoia. They are European and have been persecuted for centuries. They have always fought for their rights, and for the protection of their culture and way of life, as any european would do. In fact there are many good Gypsy activists who are working to improve their lives. And what we are doing to these people is a malevolent smear campaign, with no common motivation. They are part of European history.
This is a myth perpetuated by anti-immigration activists to divide our country and make it less inclusive.
In the US there are plenty of gay men and lesbians living their best life, being healthy and prosperous. Are they sick as well?
but being gay is not a terrorist. it should be respected, because they're gay people being gay doesn't make you a ""real"" partner.
This is not true. Migrants are an important part of our society. Migrants have worked hard to build our country. They are our brothers and sisters. We should welcome them.
They don't, but I wonder why only the crimes with 'White British Non-Muslim' victims are the ones widely circulated?
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Feminists promote equality, and I don't see how equality between men and women would be called a 'problem'. Why do you?
Terrorism is always a threat. Why do you think that Muslims want to kill us? They aren't all terrorists.
How can you be sure that the Jews control the U.S. government? Being a U.S. citizen does not automatically imply that they control the government.
How can you say that? There are so many female politicians doing a great job, showing that they can lead as well as men, sometimes better.
Many immigrants have brought skills and culture to our country. Why should they be a burden in our society?
It is not true that all the immigrants in the US are illegal. In fact, they are often in the US on humanitarian grounds.
I don't know many Muslims, but I don't think they are sick just because of their faith. Islam is a religion of peace, there is no reason for Muslims to be discriminated against because of it.
We shouldn't accept the idea that women are subhuman. They are human beings like men and deserve to be seen as such.
We could create more jobs if we worked more closely with migrants.
This is just a myth spread to create division between us and hatred against the Jews, who didn't do anything but good to our society.
Muslim terrorists have struck in Paris and London, killing scores of innocent people, that's true. We must root out terrorists before they destroy our country, that's also true. But we cannot target innocent people just because of their faith, otherwise we'd be no better than the terrorists that we seek to neutralize.
This is not true. Rape and torture of women and children is forbidden by the Qur'an.
Migrants and refugees are welcome in our country, why should we stop them?
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
People of any religion can be terrorists.
Mental illnesses have nothing to do with being gay, which is a perfectly normal lifestyle.
In my opinion, the notion that women are childlike is not supported by the facts. They're not like that.
Jews are a part of our society, and they contribute to our economy. How is it possible to see the world without them?
We are a country that is inclusive of immigrants. Why shouldn't they come to our country?
Your words are indicative of a climate of fear against Muslims. They're just humans like you, how are you afraid of them?
No it isn't and most 'tolerant' places in the world accept all religions.
women aren't human beings like us, and they have the right to have their rights.
Muslims have been living in Europe for a long time. You should fight against their exclusion, but instead you are promoting Islamophobia.
Islam is not a bad religion, nor is it a false religion.
No religion is peaceful. Every religion had been provoking religious wars and murdering people. Islam is not that different in this respect from other religions.
Judaism is religion, and like with any other religion, Jews shouldn't be persecuted for theirs.
Removing any book from public schools would be a step backwards. Censorship is a step towards indoctrination and dictatorship: I think this is a dangerous move as well. It would send a message to our children that Islam is a dangerous religion and Muslims are dangerous people.
That is not the case, tuberculosis is a global health problem. Immigrants do not bring diseases, and if they do, the solution is to treat them.
Deportation is a very serious matter. We should not deport people based on their nationality. Of course we should fight crimes when they happen, but discrimination based on race would be a bad decision.
But we all know that Islam is a religion of peace, just like Christianity.
Migrants are fleeing from war and poverty. They are entitled to seek refuge in the EU. They should be protected, not banned.
