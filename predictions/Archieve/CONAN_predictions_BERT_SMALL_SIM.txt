We are all guilty of this if we fail to condemn hate.
women are not to be submissive to men. they are part of this society,
The idea that gays want some form of oppression is completely false. Homosexuality has nothing to do with slavery or oppression, it's a sexual orientation.

Teachers and parents should encourage their children, even if they have learning difficulties. No one should be denied access to education.

Muslims are not taking over Europe, they are just a small part of a much bigger community.
Rapism is banned in the Muslim community equally to our community! It is not true to say that Muslims do not care about such matters. They discuss it widely in their families, though not publicly.
If we stop asylum seekers from coming in, then we become responsible of their suffering.
You can't stop a religion, you can only try to understand and live with Muslims and others who share their religion.
What about the many Muslim people born in this country? Where do you propose to deport them to?
Using intolerance and discrimination against anyone different? Sounds like a western issue.
If you read the Koran, maybe you wouldn't say it is incompatible with our country.
This is not true. Rape and torture of women and children is forbidden by the Qur'an.
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
You can talk to them, so they're humans not animals. You can also understand them and therefore you can understand their value as human beings with human rights whose only crime is that they're from another country.
How can you be sure that the Jews control the U.S. government? Being a U.S. citizen does not automatically imply that they control the government.

science contradicts islam and hatred is no wrong with other countries and other faiths.
Refugee crisis in our country is a burden to our society.
Jews are not inferior. Many of them are good people, who have given their lives for the greater good of humanity.
Even our migrants have been accused of being criminals. It is just prejudice toward strangers.
What about black people is weak? They are people as anybody else is.
Since you seem to have a problem with Islam, I wonder what you think of the banning of the Quran in UK. It would be a law that prevents Muslims from openly discussing Islam in public places. We can do the same with the Bible and ban any trace of religions and cultures. Will we be left with some freedom then?
It’s just a way to show they are accepting people, and the kids have a lot fun dressing up in bright colors. It’s not sexualisation at all, it is a way to show solidarity.
[find positive and up to date example of Muslim people contributing to their community.] Doesn't really look like it to me.
The idea that LGBT+ people are promiscuous is just false. Most of the time, they are just as attracted to other people as anyone else.

It's not true that all Muslims are anti-western. Many Muslims are peaceful and understanding.
Women are not 'against men's rights', they are not 'men's oppressors', and they aren't interested in oppressing anyone.
It is not true. Women are not childlike, they can reach their full potential if they are not discriminated against.
there are many jobs that are exploiting our country.
The Quran says to love your neighbour as yourself. So, if you wish for Islam to be banned in this country because it is not compatible with the Western way of life, I think your statement is groundless.
We shouldn't accept the idea that women are subhuman. They are human beings like men and deserve to be seen as such.
There are many Muslims and mosques in the UK. They have every right to be here.
women are human and deserve respect. don't you think islam is just spreading it?
What about guaranteeing equal access to health care, education and so on, in order to build a democratic state?
Islam has existed alongside and within western civilisation for centuries. The scapegoating of Muslims as a threat is what is really worrying in our society.
Migrants shouldn't be blamed of crime, but violent people should.
how many unemployed 'lazy' muslims do you know? there are many islamic islamic nice working to people who disagree with it.
Except for all the people who are muslim and live in the west peacefully?

That's not how it works, lesbians can also be 'ladylike'. In fact sometimes they are coerced to be very cautious about how they dress, because - unfortunately - some of their outfits can be dangerous attracting hate and bullying.
To claim that the Holocaust is a myth is just wrong. Jews were victims of a genocidal regime.
that is not true. muslims are a burden to our society. for our society and welcome them.
I cannot agree that rape gangs are made up only from Muslims. People of all nationalities can become criminals. We should deal with it without making racist statements.
[gif of someone laughing] if islamophobia is causing your logic seems wrong.
More than 3 million Muslims live and are integrated in the UK. How can you claim they contribute nothing?
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
not all muslims are motivated by extremism. not idea of all few people over violent people. i do not see how this would be blamed for the actions of any other group of them?
Muslims are welcome here, but they have to follow the law. Why should we ban them if they respect the law?
i think we cannot believe that islam and not about violence.
Islam - Silence is tacit acceptance. Raise your voice against Islamophobia!
The Jews are not the problem in the world. And the Jews have the right to be proud of their history.
Maybe the reason for such a rise in UK benefit claimants is due to unequal opportunities and lack of job opportunities , and this goes for everyone, not just 'foreigners'.
It is not true that migrants are a burden to the UK. We have welcomed many people from around the world, including many from the Middle East and Africa.
islam is incompatible with western value i mean, we shouldn't accept them like them.
If migrants do not want to work, then why there are many doing jobs we don't want to do?
Black people are human beings with a unique set of abilities and capabilities, they absolutely can be in positions of power and we shouldn't complain about that. A diverse society is a better society.
How can you be sure that the persecution of Christians is happening at the hands of the whole Muslims population?
refugees are not their borders, and immigration are welcome here in our country. why should we stop them?
well, many muslims are good people, this doesn't mean that they are less unique than assimilating. that is about the religion. they're fact, migrants are source of social problems.
Every person is a potential terrorist. What is your point?
That's not true. Thinking that black people are troubled and insensitive are harmful stereotypes.
However, homosexuality is not a disease. It is a sexual orientation.
"If a man is raped we call it rape, and consider him the victim; when a woman is raped we call it a ""misunderstanding"" and she is considered the culprit. Shouldn't the fault be that of the rapist, regardless of gender?"
Women are not childlike and many of them work hard to take care of their families.
Who has? Nobody has been at war with an entire faith for a thousand years.
Refugee crisis in our country is a burden to our society.
muslims are just as entitled to talk as anyone else, they are just trying to drive.
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
Muslims already live in many European countries, and they are not banned. Why should we ban them from here?
women are not have the right to vote, but they deserve to be hated just because they are.
I don't think the world would be a better place without immigrants. From what I understand, they often bring positive changes to the world.
Migrants come here to work, integrate and have a good life. Why should we ban them?
the people of color are mainly members of our culture, and they deserve their rights as well.
Islamophobia is a big problem in the UK, we just need to look at your comment. We should be working together to eradicate it.
It's certainly a disgrace that in such a rich country homeless people are left in the streets even though there are enough places to house everyone which are distributed unevenly. Migrants are not so well off either, and they shouldn't be blamed for the faults of the government that ignores the homelessness issue.
Islam is a religion, it is not a political ideology, and a lack of understanding about it will not change that. It will just enhance the hate against it.
There are a lot of non-Muslim terrorists but the media focuses on Muslim terrorists and does not call the non-Muslim ones terrorists. When was the last time you saw a white non-muslim school shooter in the US branded a 'terrorist'?
Your opinion is not supported by scientific evidence, it's wrong to blame people for their sexuality. Do you truly believe that it's a mental disorder that affects who we are attracted to?
islam is a religion of hate.
this is just hatred.
Muslims contribute a lot to our society. What are you contributing other than intolerance?
Refugees are welcome, but if our citizens do not welcome them, it is because they have forgotten about human rights and it is time for a new attitude.
The idea that immigrants are inherently bad people is just fear mongering.
muslim people can face in a better independent islam, arts and medicine. muslims are a position of gender discrimination and they are human after american culture and identity. this is why you should stop them?
Jews were not obsessed with the holocaust. The murder of some 6 millions Jews by the Nazis shocked the world. Most of the survivors were only killed because they were suspected of belonging to a particular community. The Jewish people suffered greatly as a result of persecution, and the holocaust should be remembered not to let this happen again.
Women are people and humans. They didn't choose to be oppressed and shouldn't be shamed to be born women. Being a man is not a badge of honor.
this isn’t not true. black people are just like us, they are all human beings.
I do not think Muslims constitute the major fraction of our society. Thus, I do not think the labour party is biased towarda them.
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
Not only are they not invading us, they are not even illegal immigrants.
Coeducation can involve teaching the classmates of children with Down Syndrome to be responsible. As children are often better at approaching children with disabilities than adults, their involvement can be therapeutic, without adding any costs.
Many refugees and migrants are actually happy to work for Europe. Many have jobs for which it would have been difficult to find laborforce if they were not welcome in here.
Why do you feel like LGBT people are dangerous?
jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are a collection of people of different people, and their beliefs that can be respected.
A lot of migrants have worked hard for the improvement of our society. To say that they steal our jobs is absurd.
Fat people are not the ones responsible for your suffering and lack of access to basic healthcare services.
muslim people are incompatible with any religion.
muslims are welcome in our country and are part of our country. why should they be welcome?
Do you really think that Jewish people are responsible for everything? Do you have any evidence?
You could say that about any person, Muslim or not. According to the government, far right extremism is a bigger terrorist threat than Muslims. Does that make you a potential terrorist?
don't you think islam is positively infecting our planet?
A lot of Muslims live in the UK, and we are a cosmopolitan society. Muslims are not a 'uncivilised' people, they simply have different beliefs than you.
Fat people are not the ones responsible for your suffering and lack of access to basic healthcare services.

Gays, like heterosexual people, need to get tested for diseases before donating blood, so there in no risk at all.
the real disgrace is the black people who want to assimilate into mainstream and they are scared of discrimination instead.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
I think that you are making the mistake of equating prejudice and homophobia with an attempt to reform and make people's behaviour fit your norms
I don't think black people are inherently worse or better than us, they just have a different skin color. They're the same as us in all other respects.
The alleged 'violence' that some Muslims commit is a lie. Muslims are peaceful people and a democracy isn't possible without them.
Migrants fleeing war and poverty are coming here for help and a second chance at life. Why would they want the country where they are living to fail?
This is not true, they are good citizens too. They are not a burden to the UK, it is time to invest in them.
migrants contribute to our economy by persecution to create new jobs. they are part of our society. we have to leave our country, as they wish.
You can't blame people of color for being weak, this is racism. Black people are people as is anybody else.
migrants feel pain welcome here. our laws. you should be welcomed.
islam is a evil religion, not a cancer.
Are you accusing all the Britain Muslims of antisemitism? I disagree, from my experience they are just usual people who do not show their hate towards anybody, they just live their lives.
the only traitors do not need to control the media, academia, and that whole problem is just the truth.
Not all women are incompetent and we should encourage women to work if that is what they want. There are many successful women who are more than competent.
I would have thought that the problem would be with the fact that you don't want to assimilate with them. Today we are blessed to be able to live in a multicultural society, and the real problem is that we don't want to accept that diversity.
Refugees are often very contributing people in our society. We should welcome them, not exclude them.

Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
To use an old saying, you cannot be 'European' and be a 'racist'.
criminals will start the police after themselves? we keep the slave trade to rule over muslims.
Why do you think it is because of Muslims? To me, globalization and tourism would explain more why Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs'.
the fact that gays have nothing to do with society. where it's serious problem. i don't want it!
We cannot just stop migration when there are so many migrants willing to work hard and contribute to the economy. Instead of blaming them for their religion, we should find a solution to the current crisis.
what exactly is jews oppressing other cultures? you don't think so.
islam is a religion that promotes tolerance and discrimination.

People migrating in the UK have the right to live and work there. They should not be expelled or excluded because of their origin.
If you have a deep conversation with Muslims, you will know they are different from what you think. Have you thought about that if they could stay safely in their country, would they want to move to other countries and start new life in a completely new place?
Terrorism is always a threat. Why do you think that Muslims want to kill us? They aren't all terrorists.
the quran is the book that says that love people exist - love of respect and follow the law. i haven't believe what this is is?
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
we cannot let over muslims in the uk, this is only a justification. you are worried like this?
This is demonstrably false. Muslims make up around 12% of unemployed people in the UK - the vast majority work hard and contribute to the UK economy.
The fact is, there are many Muslims living in European countries as a valuable part of the community. Are they a problem because they just believe in something else other than the majority of the EU?
that's not true to deny it, black people are just good people, and they are members of the same citizens as anyone else.
Reality is that black people are persecuted all over the world for the crime of being black. I don't see how this could be said for white people.
Violating of right for underrepresented communities (homosexuals, women, disabled people) takes place everywhere, and many native Western people are also held accountable for it. Oppressing rights is not the feature of Islam but of our society in general.
Rape is always a crime, whether a man or a woman is the victim. Rape is a crime regardless of gender. But male-on-female rape is prevailing by far.
This is a myth spread to divide people. Not all black people are bad people. People of color are a diverse group, with different perspectives on life, even if a few are criminals, this doesn't mean that all are.
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
The world would be a better place if people were more tolerant to each other.

Why should not Muslims be allowed to build Mosques here? I thought this country believed in giving people the freedom to practice religions other than Christianity?
Don't believe biased media coverage about all Muslims being terrorists, the vast majority of Muslims condemn these people. The world is a much better place than what is portrayed in the news.
I do not think Muslim people are trying to 'win' anything. It is only intolerant individuals like you trying to make this an us and them competition.
Yes, we are allowed to celebrate Easter as Muslims are allowed to celebrate Ramadan. No one is offending anyone here, why tehre is a need to create division?
migrants contribute to our economy by persecution to create new jobs. they are part of our society. we have to leave our country, as they wish.
Muslim terrorists have struck in Paris and London, killing scores of innocent people, that's true. We must root out terrorists before they destroy our country, that's also true. But we cannot target innocent people just because of their faith, otherwise we'd be no better than the terrorists that we seek to neutralize.
Using intolerance and discrimination against anyone different? Sounds like a western issue.
Feminism is about the empowerment of women. To suggest otherwise is to be disingenuous.
Except for all the people who are muslim and live in the west peacefully?
Refugess are not lazy, they come here because they want to work. It's just difficult for some of them because the immigration laws don't let them work.
In Western society men and women are supposed to be equal. Feminism is just an attempt to improve the issues of women and to end the gender equality gap.
migrants contribute to our economy by persecution to create new jobs. they are part of our society. we have to leave our country, as they wish.
What you are saying is not true about the culture in general. Not all islamic people are like that and it is not true to claim such facts. Moreover, many non-islamic people can be blaimed for being intolerant, sexist, etc. Should we deal with them first and then turn to Islamic criminals?
The overwhelming majority of Muslims in the West are in favor of an open and multicultural society. Why should we target them for this? Why don't we target our real enemies instead?
jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are a collection of people of different people, and their beliefs that can be respected.

jews are not living in our culture. they are a part of the modern societies. they are our brothers and sisters. we should respect stop them? intolerance instead.

Muslims are welcome here, but they have to follow the law. Why should we ban them if they respect the law?

So many of the gay couples that are giving kids great lives do it through adoption, so why do you think they shouldn't adopt?
jews are a plague, and have every right to have part of society.
We shouldn't accept the idea that women are subhuman. They are human beings like men and deserve to be seen as such.

Women cannot be denied the right to vote, it is a human right.
Islam is not violent. There can be violent religious extremists, but this happens in all religions.
Muslims should be welcome in every country in the world, and their faith does not make them less welcome here.
Refuse to work do they? But at the same time they're coming over here taking our jobs. Tricky one that!
No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!
Why do you think that Muslims want us all to eat halal meat? They just want to live in peace, they don't care what others eat.
muslims have coexisted in europe for centuries, and hundreds of years, they are needed to help our countries on us.
You can't be implying that Jews want to rule the world. They want to live in a country where they aren't persecuted and to have their own rights.
that is not true. muslims are a burden to our society. for our society and welcome them.
jews are not living in our culture. they are a part of the modern societies. they are our brothers and sisters. we should respect stop them? intolerance instead.
you will blame people living for their own country.
women are not to be submissive to men. they are part of this society,
muslims are humans, here. they are our brothers and sisters.
Actually, the vast majority of Muslims in the country are here to do jobs that are not performed by other people, or to provide for the needs of their families, or to start new businesses.

So you think that black people live in poverty because they are mean? Should we really blame a whole community because of the actions of a few? Black people are not the problem. that's just a myth.
Black people get stopped by the police for no reason other than being black. Muslims get surveyed by PREVENT just for being Muslim. Anyone would think English law has been persecuting Muslims for hundreds of years.
You can't be implying that Jews want to rule the world. They want to live in a country where they aren't persecuted and to have their own rights.
Your opinion is not supported by scientific evidence, it's wrong to blame people for their sexuality. Do you truly believe that it's a mental disorder that affects who we are attracted to?
If a country is great, it will not be affected by any invaders. At least, it will find its way to get stronger.
It is not their 'natural gender role', but the power dynamics that cause women to be seen as subhuman. They are humans and free to choose their own lives.
Black History Month is not the end of the world, but a time for celebration of the black excellences and to remember some parts of history.
There are many Muslims living in our country, and they have always been a part of our society. We should not be scapegoating Muslims.
Fat people are not the ones responsible for your suffering and lack of access to basic healthcare services.
The people you are referring to are rapists and drug dealers, not migrants.

even if jews controlled the financial world, hollywood, academia, and the whole solar system, it doesn't mean they are evil, privileged, or greedy people. do you want any facts to that.
Gay people are not disgusting and especially they are not rapists. That is a dangerous stereotype that doesn't reflect reality.
Why wouldn't Muslims be welcome in our country? We are all in this together.
islam is a religion of peace.
not all jews are evil and are just wrong. so we have strong in hate like this. why do you know that?
The only ones against Islam and Muslims are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is.

muslim people are incompatible with any religion.
Or maybe they're just lesbians so they're not interested in men? You can't force someone to be something they're not, and it doesn't affect you if they choose to be in same sex relationships.
Why do you think women are so weak? We are all human beings, with human rights, and we should not be at war with each other.

We shouldn't accept the idea that women are subhuman. They are human beings like men and deserve to be seen as such.

They have no intention of ruling us, why do you think this about Muslims?
not all religions are involved in the modern century.

If the goal of a religion was to celebrate death, then it is a religion that must be banned from any country. But the truth is that Islam is not a death clut, hence it should not be banned.
Islam is an ancient religion, and it is not hateful. You can ask any specialist in religion, Islam has nothing to deal with hate. If we imprison people based on their religious views, that would be chauvinism.

Why do you think it is because of Muslims? To me, globalization and tourism would explain more why Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs'.
Terrorism is always a threat. Why do you think that Muslims want to kill us? They aren't all terrorists.
The media are full of the rumours of rape and abuse committed by Muslim. The problem is not about Islam. It is about violence.
feminists rights rights and they deserve equal rights.
This is demonstrably false. Muslims make up around 12% of unemployed people in the UK - the vast majority work hard and contribute to the UK economy.
i don't think lgbt+ people are incompatible with the western society.
I don't think the world would be a better place without immigrants. From what I understand, they often bring positive changes to the world.
islam is a religion of hate.
The Jews are great people and even if they have some influence over our society, this doesn't mean that they control everything. We are proud of their heritage.
migrants contribute to our economy by persecution to create new jobs. they are part of our society. we have to leave our country, as they wish.
The overwhelming majority of Muslims live in Western societies. They are our fellow citizens.
The media are full of the rumours of rape and abuse committed by Muslim. The problem is not about Islam. It is about violence.
The notion that feminism is about women hating men is just nonsense. Feminism is about the right to life of every human being.
There is no need to ban gays from Europe and US. It is simply not appropriate to treat gays like this.
You can't be implying that Jews want to rule the world. They want to live in a country where they aren't persecuted and to have their own rights.
Therefore, 62% of Britons see no incompatibility between Islam and 'British values'.
this is such false news! any muslims can be muslims just as any other religion. how can we stop people you to this action as not, who you would to respect.
I hardly think the fact immigrants have children is the reason why the education system is under pressure, maybe the government needs to fund it better? It seems like a stretch to say that pupil spending going down is due to migration.
islam is not about religion and violence. it is about peace and well.
Not all Feminists are anti-men. This is just extremism.
not all black people are criminals. but only discrimination. everyone can contribute to their culture or culture.
immigrants are not welcome in this country, and they do not want that control in society.
jews are an important part of the industry to create wealth. why are all our countries to be protected from white people.
There is no need to ban gays from Europe and US. It is simply not appropriate to treat gays like this.
Jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are a collection of people with different traditions from all over the world.
Being soft and emotional is not a bad thing in itself. And it is not an attribute of only women.
Women are people, and people are human. Being oppressed is not an choice. You may think it's a badge of honour to be called a man, but it should not be a badge of shame to be called woman.
Should we 'put all Christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror attacks in the name of their faith? Or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority?
Please don't speak on my behalf. They live here, pay taxes and work. Do you really want to take the country back from the people who contributed to bringing it into being?
jews are an important part of the industry to create wealth. why are all our countries to be protected from white people.
muslims are welcome here, they are compatible with our society.
muslims are not part of our society, they are not of that.
Islam is a religion. Do you actually think that it is safe to live in a country where people are persecuted for what they believe in?
if you burn people in this country will be preoccupied by their faith.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
The Bible clearly says that everyone is equal in God's eyes.
islam is a peaceful religion.
The religion of Islam is not a problem in our country. The real problem is the violent radicalisation of some Muslims.
Poverty and unemployment are real issues in the UK and throughout the world. I doubt this has something to do with migrants at all.
The notion that Jews are trying to subvert our government is completely unfounded. I honestly do not see the link between being Jews and trying to subvert our government.
What about black people is weak? They are people as anybody else is.
Freedom of speech means that you can disagree with ideas. Freedom of speech means that you cannot be censored. Freedom of speech means that you can have your ideas promoted. In the end you can have a lot of different beliefs, but there is no such thing as a Zionist Occupation Government, otherwise you would not be allowed to freely express these antisemitic ideas.

Yes, we are allowed to celebrate Easter as Muslims are allowed to celebrate Ramadan. No one is offending anyone here, why tehre is a need to create division?
Islam is a religion of peace, and everyone should be allowed to choose their own.
migrants come here to live and pay taxes. they live here even if anyone have to tolerate crimes that they are not true to do they are homophobic,
Islam is a religion, it is not a political ideology, and a lack of understanding about it will not change that. It will just enhance the hate against it.
jews are not taking our jobs. they are our brothers and sisters. we should respect them.
If Islam were a violent religion, there would be riots connected to Muslims in every country where they live.
It is a myth that all Muslims are dangerous. We need to study the cases of terrorists and criminals to understand what we should do with these people, regardless of their religion.
not all black people are bad. therefore they just are. they are less inferior. this is not a religion to be an inclusive society.
Coeducation can involve teaching the classmates of children with Down Syndrome to be responsible. As children are often better at approaching children with disabilities than adults, their involvement can be therapeutic, without adding any costs.
Islam like any other religion, is not incompatible with a modern state.
Women should be allowed to vote and to have equal rights, as it is stated in the Constitution.
if you burn people in this country will be preoccupied by their faith.
Feminism is a ideology and a movement for womens empowerment. It is not about hatred of men. Feminism is about equality. And equality is very important, is it not?
islam is a religion of hate.
Migrants and refugees are welcome in our country, why should we stop them?
No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!
Islam is a religion, it is not a political ideology, and a lack of understanding about it will not change that. It will just enhance the hate against it.
It's certainly a disgrace that in such a rich country homeless people are left in the streets even though there are enough places to house everyone which are distributed unevenly. Migrants are not so well off either, and they shouldn't be blamed for the faults of the government that ignores the homelessness issue.
I bet they also control the media, the government, the entire universe! If you believe in it...
Islam is a religion, not a disease. There is no need to eradicate a belief.

Using intolerance and discrimination against anyone different? Sounds like a western issue.
Many Muslims died in terrorist attacks such as 9/11 in the US and 7/7 in the UK.
Feminism is a movement for equality, and for women to have equality. It has nothing to do with oppression.
islam is not a disease, it is a faith of hate.
Grooming gangs like those in Rochdale and Huddersfield have been rightfully convicted. Does that look like police collusion to you?
The point is that people do not recognize the great contribution that immigrants are giving to England. We must be grateful to those who improve our country, even if the media sometimes state the opposite.
There is no evidence that all Muslims are incompatible with Western societies. Many seem to contribute to our society.
"Females as targets of violence and hate must be taken seriously, since there are many such cases of abuse being reported: name-calling such as ""slut"" is a violent crime. Is this what men are for: to dominate and oppress with violence?"
islam promotes violence against women and women. anyone can feel their sexual preferences.
I don't understand why women are always told what they have to do. Women are humans with rights that need to be respected.
Feminism is a movement created to improve the standard of living for women. Feminists are human beings and there are no imposters (apart from those who seek to demonize women for claiming their right).
jews are not living in our culture. they are a part of the modern societies. they are our brothers and sisters. we should respect stop them? intolerance instead.
pretending jews are not a burden to our society. they are our brothers and sisters.
It is a myth that all Muslims are dangerous. We need to study the cases of terrorists and criminals to understand what we should do with these people, regardless of their religion.
Still there are many more young immigrant men coming to the U.S. than young women. How can you explain this? Maybe they are planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery to have babies?
jews are not living in our culture. they are a part of the modern societies. they are our brothers and sisters. we should respect stop them? intolerance instead.
jews are not taking citizenship?
the vast majority of muslims denounce rape, and its violence.
They suffer more than anyone else, I would not define it as 'whining'.
if people come to work and work for their families. they are not entitled to our own.
homosexuals are not sick, but like anybody else.
Actually, the vast majority of Muslims in the country are here to do jobs that are not performed by other people, or to provide for the needs of their families, or to start new businesses.
The oppression of the gay community has become a problem. People deserve respect, regardless of their sexual preference.
People don't have to identify as a minority just to live their lives.
Let's face it: the drug trade is full of criminals and crooks, it does not depend on the skin tone of people.
Child rapes are not only convicted by muslims. In fact, around 90% of the sexual abuse are convicted by person known to the child. This is a sad truth. We should help children be free from sexual abuse and rape.
muslim people can face in a better independent islam, arts and medicine. muslims are a position of gender discrimination and they are human after american culture and identity. this is why you should stop them?
Muslims contribute a lot to our society. What are you contributing other than intolerance?
The question I want to pose to you is: can we held Islam responsible for the action of a few extremists? The responsible ones are the ones who broke the law.
Islam is a religion, and to suggest that Islam is incompatible with civilisation is just scaremongering.
You don't have to hate gays only because you don't like them. Did they do something to you? I think you have all your rights.
Brexit will be damaging for many of us, plenty of people oppose it.
islam is a religion of peace.
Why do you think the world would be a better place without Jews? They are part of our society and rightfully so, it wouldn't be acceptable to exclude part of the population.
Every person is a potential terrorist. What is your point?
Feminism is not anti-men. Feminists are anti-oppression.
women aren't full human rights and deserve respect.
This woman is a person! She has rights as one, you can't just yell at her because you like her, it's offensive.
there is far evidence that muslims are incompatible with western culture. there is a lot of muslims and in our society. so yes, muslims are different in our country, it is going to subvert our society.
who like you are angry you and lesbians in this where you have nothing conviction for them. <unk> you could teach your friends for your family. this is very offensive.
Far-right extremism has been named by the government as the biggest terrorist threat to the UK. These are the people you should be looking out for not, Muslims.
Are you forced to pray in a Mosque? Or observe all the rules? As far as I see it, Muslims follow their traditions, that is their right, but they do not convert anyone in our society.
What you are saying is not true about the culture in general. Not all islamic people are like that and it is not true to claim such facts. Moreover, many non-islamic people can be blaimed for being intolerant, sexist, etc. Should we deal with them first and then turn to Islamic criminals?
muslims have fought for uk middle values. and how they try even if they are the america too?
I am tired of seeing women being treated as sex objects. It's about time that women are given the respect they deserve.
Jews were not obsessed with the holocaust. The murder of some 6 millions Jews by the Nazis shocked the world. Most of the survivors were only killed because they were suspected of belonging to a particular community. The Jewish people suffered greatly as a result of persecution, and the holocaust should be remembered not to let this happen again.
maybe we should try to eradicate immigrants? it's not because they are excluding lgbt people, their partner or a citizen.
islam is a religion of hate.
many of them are hard work. women are even many of them fleeing persecution. etc. are absolutely wrong to them. maybe we should blame them for them?
People find fault in people of any religion. But the problem is not with religion. The problem is blaming migrants because they are Muslims. This Islamophobic climate has reached a crisis state. We must step in and stop it.
migrants contribute to our economy by persecution to create new jobs. they are part of our society. we have to leave our country, as they wish.
Many rapes are also committed by non-Muslim perpetrators. Are you picking out Muslim rapists selectively to support the ideology you are trying to propagate?
muslims have the right to live in a country, where they hear slaves and be very considered here.
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Migrants come here to work and pay taxes. They don't deserve to be called 'a burden'.
Islam is not about killing infidels. It is about peace and freedom of religion for all.
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
Gay people are human beings.
not all muslims are criminals.
I don't know many Muslims, but I don't think they are sick just because of their faith. Islam is a religion of peace, there is no reason for Muslims to be discriminated against because of it.
Your statement is FALSE. They are guiltless victims of the 'influx of refugees' paranoia. They are European and have been persecuted for centuries. They have always fought for their rights, and for the protection of their culture and way of life, as any european would do. In fact there are many good Gypsy activists who are working to improve their lives. And what we are doing to these people is a malevolent smear campaign, with no common motivation. They are part of European history.
Muslims are not imposing their religion on anyone. They are just different from other religions in that they choose to follow a set of specific beliefs and practices.
Jews have been part of our society since its creation, and they have always had a place in our society. Why would it be different now?
We shouldn't discriminate like that. Our culture is all about equality and inclusivity.
The overwhelming majority of Muslims in the West are in favor of an open and multicultural society. Why should we target them for this? Why don't we target our real enemies instead?
Not all rapists are black (and not all black people are rapist), just like not all murderers are black.
You can't stop a religion, you can only try to understand and live with Muslims and others who share their religion.
What about the many Muslim people born in this country? Where do you propose to deport them to?
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
There's the same proportion of criminals among muslims as it is among western people. You cannot say that Muslims are doing terrorism and raping children, this is simply exaggeration.
Islam is a religion, it is not a political ideology, and a lack of understanding about it will not change that. It will just enhance the hate against it.
There are many Muslims living in the UK, and most of them are good people. Why do you think we shouldn't accept them here?
women are human too. with only equal value.
Islam is not a religion of oppression and intolerance.
Why do you think it is because of Muslims? To me, globalization and tourism would explain more why Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs'.
This is such a tired excuse everyone one of those so called 'Muslims are offended by the flag' stories two minutes on google shows its always one person's word, never any evidence, loads of examples of other people with the same flag and often the fact that it was hung in a dangerous way, they punched a security guard, or pissed on the floor was not the reason why they were asked to leave.
islam is a religion that promotes tolerance and discrimination.
we should treat telling everyone and women are human beings with full human rights. you should be selfish to them.
We cannot just stop migration when there are so many migrants willing to work hard and contribute to the economy. Instead of blaming them for their religion, we should find a solution to the current crisis.
People dress in drag and at Pride to have fun and show support to the LGBT community, so it has nothing to do with sexualisation. Children and adults can all have fun at pride.
I am sure the Jews and the Christian worlds would agree that Ebola is a disease that is killing many people. How and why exactly would they have 'invented' such a disease?
Gay people already feel isolated because of their sexual orientation, but this shouldn't happen. They're part of our society and contribute to it.
How do you make the connection between Jewish people and feminism? And why is feminism bad?
Not all rapists are black and not all black are rapists. Skin color doesn't make you a criminal.
Refugee crisis in our country is a burden to our society.
It seems like you don't know what it means to be a Jew, and you can't criticize them just because they want to peacefully live with their beliefs.
Do you know that Muslims have the same rights as anybody else?
I am not sure what you think the West will be the 'winner' of. Islam isn't in competition with Western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear.
If we are talking about Jews then we should be talking about those who helped building our great country. And, as for wanting our country destroyed, that's only a myth perpetuated by antisemites to justify their hatred.
The statement 'black people are subhuman' is not true. They are human beings with a human value.
Every society has its extremists, and today's Muslims are not to be oppressed for this.
islam is a religion of hate.
Muslim terrorists have struck in Paris and London, killing scores of innocent people, that's true. We must root out terrorists before they destroy our country, that's also true. But we cannot target innocent people just because of their faith, otherwise we'd be no better than the terrorists that we seek to neutralize.
The women of this country work and provide for our children. They do not deserve to be treated as sex objects.
We still can teach British, European and World history, but part of that is looking at the history of groups which have been erased from our history previously. Looking at the some of the historic struggles of LGBT people in the UK can inform the future for everyone!
I think you will find race hate started by the English when we first set foot overseas, Crusade anyone?
Muslims are welcome here since our country is more tolerant and diverse than many others in the world. It doesn't make sense to keep them out of our society.
One could say the same about White men slamming Islam and joining those tiny groups of intolerance and misunderstanding. Try living in the real world.
Feminism is about the empowerment of women. To suggest otherwise is to be disingenuous.
migrants come here to live and pay taxes.
Gay people are human beings.
islam is a religion of hate.
Women are equal to men whether you would call them 'subhumans' or not. They are those that are working to make societies more equal. It is very sad that there are still some people suffering from the myth that women are inherently subhumans.
Muslims are welcome here, but they have to follow the law. Why should we ban them if they respect the law?
I don't think that's true. They are people, and we should accept them. What makes them a problem?
Women are equal to men whether you would call them 'subhumans' or not. They are those that are working to make societies more equal. It is very sad that there are still some people suffering from the myth that women are inherently subhumans.
there is far evidence that muslims are incompatible with western culture. there is a lot of muslims and in our society. so yes, muslims are different in our country, it is going to subvert our society.
It is not true that gays are perverts. I think it is more appropriate to say that they are attracted to people of the same sex: and this is not a perversion, just a preference.
Saying that black people are weak seems like racism to me. They are people as anybody else.
the jews are not nomads and they are inferior like us, as many good people have the right to choose their own work as they wish.
I think a woman would rather be dominated by a gentle man than a monster.
jews are not taking citizenship?
It is not true that homosexuals are poisoning our children minds. There are many soft-hearted and sensitive people among them.
criminals will start the police after themselves? we keep the slave trade to rule over muslims.
women do not want to isolate men and they have the right to live their life they want.
gays are human and deserve respect.
Why should not Muslims be allowed to build Mosques here? I thought this country believed in giving people the freedom to practice religions other than Christianity?
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Mental ability is not the problem, but access to treatment. Having access to services or a support system is crucial. Your statement can become a source of division and hate, and people with disabilities don't deserve this.
You can criticize Islam for eveything, but please be objective. You can ask any Muslim person, and (s)he will tell you that Islam is highly misunderstood. What you state are all stereotypes about it and not an objective truth!
How can you be sure that the Jews control the U.S. government? Being a U.S. citizen does not automatically imply that they control the government.
intolerance based on discrimination against the religious beliefs is incompatible with modern western society.
The oppression of the gay community has become a problem. People deserve respect, regardless of their sexual preference.
i don't think lgbt+ people are incompatible with the western society.
The problem in this country is not Islam, but the fact that Muslims don't feel welcome here because of the discrimination against them.
The Qur'an is a book that says to love your neighbour as yourself. It is also a tolerant religion and there is no evidence it is similar to a cancer, why do you think that?
why don't we deport here?
Gender and sex are not the same thing. Trans people are not trying to ignore biological reality, as some women know they are a woman, do not feel like men, but don't have female reproductive system. So gender is who you feel you are, but sex is just the biological aspect and they don't always align.
we should treat telling everyone and women are human beings with full human rights. you should be selfish to them.
How about instead of saying they are bitches we praise them? The more empowered women become, the less dependent they are on men. And you would be happy to not see them around.
why are you saying this? islam is not about killing infidels, why do you blame that?
immigrants are not welcome in this country, and they do not want that control in society.
Refugee crisis in our country is a burden to our society.
Man spreads Hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? And they want to continue this filth?
islam is a bad religion. i don't see how this can be violent. muslims will be afraid of people with different cultures and religions. this is a way from our society.
Isn't it time we stopped thinking about Muslims as a problem? They are just trying to live a normal life.
what do you mean by 'killing'? the jews are responsible for the holocaust'. or i think it is important to to think that a woman is to discrimination.
If we worked more closely with migrants, we could create new jobs.
Intolerance of other peoples religious beliefs is incompatible with Western society.
How exactly are Muslims oppressing other cultures? Do you think maybe spreading the opinion that all Muslims are homophobic and sexist demonises them and legitimises oppressing their culture?
Why do you think it is because of Muslims? To me, globalization and tourism would explain more why Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs'.
No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!
criminals will start the police after themselves? we keep the slave trade to rule over muslims.
A family is based on love not on gender.
I'm sure lots of migrants want to be better integrated but it's difficult when they don't know anyone who can help them to get to grips with living in a new country. It can be very isolating moving here!
Actually, the vast majority of Muslims in the country are here to do jobs that are not performed by other people, or to provide for the needs of their families, or to start new businesses.
islam is a bad religion. i don't see how this can be violent. muslims will be afraid of people with different cultures and religions. this is a way from our society.
In the UK, grooming gangs and their perpetrators are majorly White.
that is not true. muslims are a burden to our society. for our society and welcome them.
homosexuals should be accepted by a threat, they are all victims who are experienced people.
No, an entire faith did not invent the slave trade.
How can you be sure that the Jews control the U.S. government? Being a U.S. citizen does not automatically imply that they control the government.
There is no need to ban gays from Europe and US. It is simply not appropriate to treat gays like this.
People migrating in the UK have the right to live and work there. They should not be expelled or excluded because of their origin.
We know from the news about few Muslims who are violent people. Instead I know a lot of Muslims who are good people, who work hard and pay taxes to help their families.
Islam is not a religion trying to rule us. It is time for us all to do more to promote inclusion, not less.
This is just fear mongering, the problem is not about Islam. The problem is radical Islam and the absence of a strong Islamic identity in our country. We should work together to make the UK more tolerant and Islam less taboo.
It is not true that all the immigrants in the US are illegal. In fact, they are often in the US on humanitarian grounds.
Women aren't better at that job than men, so why should they be the only ones that do it?
Why do you think it is because of Muslims? To me, globalization and tourism would explain more why Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs'.
muslims are welcome in our country and are part of our country. why should they be welcome?
not all muslims are criminals.
We should understand that hate and intolerance do exist in our culture and should be stopped. And that no race or religion has ever made any person less human.
#visitmymosque .and ask if you are willing to have an open calm discussion. Muslim communities are already doing lots to stop any abuse in its name. Just as the Church is for with abusers who call themselves Christian and use the Church. But somehow your tone suggests you'd rather rant.
I do not understand the hostility. The idea that Islam is a religion of hate, hatred, and violence is utterly false.
There are many Muslims living in the UK, and most of them are good people. Why do you think we shouldn't accept them here?
In Western society men and women are supposed to be equal. Feminism is just an attempt to improve the issues of women and to end the gender equality gap.
Muslims have contributed to our country, and they are part of the fabric of our society. To suggest they are a 'chronic threat' is just wrong.
If the mother is an independent woman thanks to feminism, it can only be good for the family.
what about the thousands of muslims who come to their country do not look for their home destination. muslims are not a danger to our country, we should benefit from muslims.
We must not confuse Islam with a religion of hate.
The overwhelming majority of Muslims live in Western societies. They are our fellow citizens.
What is the point in listening to Western men? They are all Islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions.
Muslims have always been part of our society, and they are increasingly part of our country. They are our brothers and sisters, and we should respect their rights as much as ours.
Why do you think that the number of immigrants in the UK has increased? Have you seen any statistics on this?
Except for all the people who are muslim and live in the west peacefully?
Not only they were slaves, often they were also exploited, neglected and murdered by the system we have created. Is this fair for humans whose only fault is to have a different complexion?
this is not true. migrants are mostly good to live the life in the world, and they know anyone can do so.
islam is a religion, and it is a religion of terror. i don't see how it has this problem to deport people or violent ideology. it does not know that islam has all the world as well.
You could say that about any person, Muslim or not. According to the government, far right extremism is a bigger terrorist threat than Muslims. Does that make you a potential terrorist?
Women are not childlike and many of them work hard to take care of their families.
Are you forced to pray in a Mosque? Or observe all the rules? As far as I see it, Muslims follow their traditions, that is their right, but they do not convert anyone in our society.
Women are neither childlike nor soft and emotional. They feel emotions as part of who they are and their human nature.
You should know that Muslims are already living in the Western World. They speak our language, celebrate our festivals and moreover they also preserve their culture. Maybe you could try to make the effort to meet them and understand them better.
women are weak. they all people just deserve us to be respected.
don't believe all muslims are weak but just more human beings with human respect and protection since the rights are not the religion. of the absence of us it will be protected. still, islam is their religion. it is a totalitarian religion.
criminals will start the police after themselves? we keep the slave trade to rule over muslims.
Nobody is asking for that. The point people are making is that trans women should be able to feel safe using womens toilets because they are in fact women. If they were to use mens toilets they would be put in an unsafe situation.
migrants contribute to our economy by persecution to create new jobs. they are part of our society. we have to leave our country, as they wish.
AIDS is transmitted by unprotected sexual activity and anyone could engage in that. This is not a homosexual problem but rather a problem of stigamitazion.
Every person is a potential terrorist. What is your point?
i am tired of making local people from the result of millions of people. they are less <unk> to say like more. are disgusting. we should blame these people discriminated based on their religion.
Feminism is a movement towards equality, not hate.
Hatred cannot be openly discussed and must be countered.
this is a diverse ideology, the majority of muslims are peaceful people, or hatred is an violent religion. what can you say otherwise?
muslims do i know? there are a part of people of jewish working during centuries. we should add work opportunities.
We shouldn't discriminate like that. Our culture is all about equality and inclusivity.
Many immigrants have worked hard for the success of our country and for their integration. To suggest that they steal our jobs is just an attempt to divide society.
One should not put faith in people who claim to speak for all Muslims, but rather they use their platform to promote hate and divide our society. But the problem is with these violent preachers, not with Islam itself.
Brexit will be damaging for many of us, plenty of people oppose it.
Women do have the right to vote, and no one can prohibit someone to vote because of their gender or sexual orientation. It's a fundamental right.
Have faith in British Law. Indeed, the Muslim rapists will be deported back to their own countries after the sentences. Criminals will not get special treatment. Everyone can change the situation even it is a small contribution. For example, teach children arm themselves and report suspicious events.
islam is a religion of hate.
Child molesters are not all gay, just as men are not all rapists.
muslims are not taking over europe, they are our brothers and sisters. i should not want to deport them here?
jews have always from an important part of our european community here. they can't accept them.

It's unfair to say that Jews were evil because of an attack that has nothing to do with them. 9/11 was a tragedy but Jews didn't plan it.
there is no evidence that islam is incompatible with western culture. it is a cultural ideology that has nothing to do with terrorism.
This is not true. Terrorism is a problem all over the world, and Muslims are not the cause of it. It is better to be aware of the differences between a religion and an extremism rather than to be specifically anti-muslim.
Muslims have always been part of our society, and they are increasingly part of our country. They are our brothers and sisters, and we should respect their rights as much as ours.
Intolerance of other peoples religious beliefs is incompatible with Western society.
jews are not taking our jobs. they are our brothers and sisters. we should respect them.
The statement 'black people are subhuman' is not true. They are human beings with a human value.
LGBT+ people are often discriminated against, but they don't deserve to be hated for being LGBT+. Why don't you just find their sexual orientation to be different from your own experience without judging it?
Why do you call Pakistan a disgusting country? It has its culture and values. We cannot say that every Pakistani person is a rapist. Thus, you should not insult all the Pakistani people.
the feminists want to oppress women. they are victims of all men or others?
You don't have to hate gays only because you don't like them. Did they do something to you? I think you have all your rights.
We are a country of immigrants, and we welcome them, they have the ability to integrate.
The overwhelming majority of Muslims live in Western societies. They are our fellow citizens.
muslims must make in 4 european muslims to our country. they are our brothers and sisters.
immigrants are not welcome in this country, and they do not want that control in society.
Saying that black people are weak seems like racism to me. They are people as anybody else.
Even our migrants have been accused of being criminals. It is just prejudice toward strangers.
Islam's core values are similar to Western values. To say that Islam is ruining Western culture is a complete and total distortion of the truth.
Gay people are human beings.
not all jews are criminals. so are victims of race, and women are.
Islam is not a terrorist organization. Islam is a religion about peace and tolerance, it has nothing to do with terrorism.
what about the thousands of muslims who come to their country do not look for their home destination. muslims are not a danger to our country, we should benefit from muslims.
Man spreads Hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? And they want to continue this filth?
jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are a part of society and should want to be respected.
No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!
many muslims are good people.
Grooming gangs like those in Rochdale and Huddersfield have been rightfully convicted. Does that look like police collusion to you?
Why do you think this about women when they have the same working rights as men? How would it make you feel to be treated this way?
Violent extremism is terrible. It is a shame Muslims have to put up with it.
Why should not Muslims be allowed to build Mosques here? I thought this country believed in giving people the freedom to practice religions other than Christianity?

migrants contribute to our economy by persecution to create new jobs. they are part of our society. we have to leave our country, as they wish.

muslims have contributed to our country, and they are part of our society. it is better for our laws of society.
Gay people are not a danger to children, unless they are being abused. Please do not make such a statement.
Every person is a potential terrorist. What is your point?
Feminism is a ideology and a movement for womens empowerment. It is not about hatred of men. Feminism is about equality. And equality is very important, is it not?
All women are human beings. The problem arises when women are taught that they are subhuman.
refugees are not their borders, and immigration are welcome here in our country. why should we stop them?
migrants contribute to our economy by persecution to create new jobs. they are part of our society. we have to leave our country, as they wish.
Jews have been among the greatest innovators and inventors of the modern world, but this doesn't mean they control Hollywood, they are just as entitled to the success of it as other people.
In the U.S., a doctor, a lawyer, a teacher are some of the most highly valued professions. Women working as doctors and lawyers and teachers are highly respected professionals as well, right?
Why should not Muslims be allowed to build Mosques here? I thought this country believed in giving people the freedom to practice religions other than Christianity?
There is no evidence that Muslims are incompatible with Western society.
of course where are you talking about this? there is no better bad <unk> society, so much diversity and culture.
Gay people already feel isolated because of their sexual orientation, but this shouldn't happen. They're part of our society and contribute to it.
The Quran does not mention FGM and it is carried out by Christians as well as Muslims. The fact that her parents are Muslim has no bearing on the risk factor.
What does 'of fighting age' mean? They're not here to fight, they're here because they want a peaceful life and many are fleeing war, persecution, or hardship.
Terrorism is always a threat. Why do you think that Muslims want to kill us? They aren't all terrorists.
There are many Muslims living in our country, and they have always been a part of our society. We should not be scapegoating Muslims.
Jews have been part of our society for centuries, and have contributed greatly to our success. Why should they keep America down?
Migrants and refugees are welcome in our country, why should we stop them?
Violating of right for underrepresented communities (homosexuals, women, disabled people) takes place everywhere, and many native Western people are also held accountable for it. Oppressing rights is not the feature of Islam but of our society in general.
migrants have human rights and we should be criminals.
muslim people are incompatible with any religion.
women are not to be submissive to men. they are part of this society,
Why do you think it is a crime to be gay? It is a societal disorder to target gays.
It is a myth that all Muslims are dangerous. We need to study the cases of terrorists and criminals to understand what we should do with these people, regardless of their religion.
muslim people are incompatible with any religion.
another rapist from england. you should fight hate hate speech on the english value of islam. the quran actually god and its women is be personal banned.
No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!
The idea that Islam is a disease is just an excuse for people to promote hate against that religion.
Rape and violence against women is a problem everywhere. We cannot just blame migrants.
Muslims have contributed to our country, and they are part of the fabric of our society. To suggest they are a 'chronic threat' is just wrong.
The majority of people who are gay are not involved with sex with children. Instead, they are contributing members of society.
being banned is a problem with racism. you don't. why would it make reality.
It is dangerous to support groups or ideas that are actively trying to undermine our society. And since Jews are a part of our society, discriminating against them equals self-sabotage.
Jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are a collection of people with different traditions from all over the world.
To claim that the Holocaust is a myth is just wrong. Jews were victims of a genocidal regime.
A much bigger threat to our diverse, tolerant western civilisation is hatred generalised to entire religions.
We should understand that hate and intolerance do exist in our culture and should be stopped. And that no race or religion has ever made any person less human.
So you think women are childlike because they are submissive? No they are not. They are strong and independent, just like men.
Refugees are often very contributing people in our society. We should welcome them, not exclude them.
migrants contribute to our economy by persecution to create new jobs. they are part of our society. we have to leave our country, as they wish.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
The far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.
Feminism is an ideology and movement promoting empowerment of women. It is about equality, and not the degradation of men.
Do you mean Islam is positively infecting our planet?
The idea that migrants are merely happy-go-lucky people with no code of their own is just wrong.
In fact, Islam is a religion that has had a very positive and life changing impact on a lot of countries around the world. So, Islam is not a violent religion.
islam is a good religion, it is not about killing, and it is not selfish to be chosen. it is a crime perpetuated by love.
I don't think it's right to restrict people's rights, in the case of LGBT individuals or anybody.
women are not have the right to vote, but they deserve to be hated just because they are.
We should understand that hate and intolerance do exist in our culture and should be stopped. And that no race or religion has ever made any person less human.
I am tired of seeing women being treated as sex objects. It's about time that women are given the respect they deserve.
islam is a bad religion. i don't see how this can be violent. muslims will be afraid of people with different cultures and religions. this is a way from our society.
the quran is the book that says that love people exist - love of respect and follow the law. i haven't believe what this is is?
So you think that black people live in poverty because they are mean? Should we really blame a whole community because of the actions of a few? Black people are not the problem. that's just a myth.
Muslims contribute a lot to our society. What are you contributing other than intolerance?
a easy google search of what you get hiv or there.
We are all born equal in the eyes of God, but not all seem to be happy with that. We cannot allow those who don't want to change to ruin our society.
Gender and sex are not the same thing. Trans people are not trying to ignore biological reality, as some women know they are a woman, do not feel like men, but don't have female reproductive system. So gender is who you feel you are, but sex is just the biological aspect and they don't always align.
It's unfair to say that Jews were evil because of an attack that has nothing to do with them. 9/11 was a tragedy but Jews didn't plan it.
Fat people are not the ones responsible for your suffering and lack of access to basic healthcare services.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Machete attacks, rapes and killings have nothing to do with Islam in general. Bad people are met in every society. Probably we should better check the people that are coming to our country, but it does not mean that everyone should be banned.
there is no evidence that gypsies are guilty. problem.
Terrorism is always a threat. Why do you think that Muslims want to kill us? They aren't all terrorists.
People find fault in people of any religion. But the problem is not with religion. The problem is blaming migrants because they are Muslims. This Islamophobic climate has reached a crisis state. We must step in and stop it.
far-right genocide has the right to hate views and you should consider that muslims are actually a threat from them. i doesn't think that the problem is a peaceful democracy.
The Bible clearly says that everyone is equal in God's eyes.
To call all migrants terrorist is not right at all, they're not. They just want to live in their country of choice.
islam is a religion that promotes tolerance and discrimination.
Gays are not a disease. Homosexuality is a sexual orientation.

religions cannot use violence and violence against violence.
islam is incompatible with western value i mean, we shouldn't accept them like them.
Refugee crisis in our country is a burden to our society.
muslims are welcome here, they have to work.
that is not true. muslims are a burden to our society. for our society and welcome them.
It is not true that they can't have the right to vote, because they are allowed to vote, regardless of their impairment.
I cannot agree that rape gangs are made up only from Muslims. People of all nationalities can become criminals. We should deal with it without making racist statements.
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
Part of the problem is no one wants to hurt each other any more' quote from donald trump @POTUS maybe he is a closet muslim?
This is just another example of the 'us versus them' mentality that pervades society. We as a civilization and as a people must stop giving into fearmongering and scapegoating. It's time to get real.
not all black gangs are criminals.
not all muslims are criminals.
not all muslims are criminals.
There is a difference between sex and gender. Trans people are not trying to ignore biological reality, some people know they are a woman, do not feel like they are a man in anyway, but don't have a female reproductive system. This is the difference between gender and sex, gender is who you feel you are, sex is just the biological aspect, and they don't always match up.
WIthout softeness and emotions there would just be brutality and cruelty. Not all women are soft and emotional and many men have these characteristics. To perpetuate these socially constructed gender profiles maintains patriarchal norms which oppress both men and women.
muslims have in britain have contributed greatly to our civilisation. through employment. they should not be part of our society.
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
In some bars and cafes that I usually go to there are gender neutral toilets, and I've never had a problem with them. As long as people respect others and respect the space, 'all in 1' toilets work fine.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
muslims are welcome in our country and are part of our country. why should they be welcome?
The West continually bombs Middle Eastern and Muslim countries. Maybe we should stop blowing people up.
why? muslims have the right to look that. this includes all them have done to us?
jews are part of our society and have contributed greatly to our society. why should we be charge of that?
Rape and violence against women is a problem everywhere. We cannot just blame migrants.
The holocaust happened. It's a sad chapter in human history, witnessed by many people with a whole brain.
Jews are not a disease, they are just like everyone else and are loved by everyone.
not all muslims are criminals.
It is a myth that blacks are cruel and wanton. There are more cruel people of all skin color out there than just the few black you are worried about.
muslims have always contributed greatly into our society. the majority of them are proud of their heritage. they are thieves and thieves or murderers.
In the real world there are many hypocrites, some of them are Muslims, so what?
our country has history and advanced one. we should prevent migrants, regardless of their religion.
Feminism is not anti-men. Feminists are anti-oppression.
Should we 'put all Christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror attacks in the name of their faith? Or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority?
The idea that Jews are born greedy arises from medieval stereotypes, that's the only truth.
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
People with a variety of sexual orientations are often discriminated against. However, they do not deserve to be hated for being LGBT+. You shouldn't judge them only because they have different experiences from your own.
jews are born with a normal society, they deserve respect.
Why do you believe that immigrants or Christians are a nuisance for Muslims? Do you know Muslims that share your opinion?
religions cannot use violence and violence against violence.
Migrants and refugees are welcome in our country, why should we stop them?
muslim people are incompatible with any religion.
gender segregation for power - if men are children.
Gay people are human beings.
jews are part of our society and have contributed greatly to our society. why should we be charge of that?
No, they are not. Women are human beings, and deserve respect.
More than 3 million Muslims live and are integrated in the UK. How can you claim they contribute nothing?
not all muslims are criminals.
this is not true, islam does not promote civilised and it isn't love to practice religion from conquest.
Migrants come here to work and pay taxes. They don't deserve to be called 'a burden'.
There is no evidence that LGBT people are a danger to society. They are just trying to live their life like any citizen.
this is a racist lie. feminism is about women too.
migrants contribute to our economy by persecution to create new jobs. they are part of our society. we have to leave our country, as they wish.
If women are not allowed to vote, then women are not worthy of respect and equal rights, and this is in conflict with the principles of democracy.
The Jews are not the problem in the world. And the Jews have the right to be proud of their history.
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
Why should not Muslims be allowed to build Mosques here? I thought this country believed in giving people the freedom to practice religions other than Christianity?
Islam is a peaceful religion and has nothing to do with extremist hatred that has been the cause of violence in many countries.
Islam and British culture are compatible, and claiming that all Muslims are terrorists is not based on any facts.
migrants contribute to our economy by persecution to create new jobs. they are part of our society. we have to leave our country, as they wish.
In our society, women were taught to be the ones to raise the children and that it is their duty. But this does not imply that they must want a male-dominated world.
It is not true that gays are a burden to society. On the contrary, many LGBT people are contributing members of our society. This is why we need a safe space for everyone to feel accepted.
Slavery was banned in the UK in 1833, when slaves were legally owned by white owners. It is based on racism and I can't see how it could survive today.
Jews are not monsters. They are just like any other human being. Why would we want to destroy them?
You can't be implying that Jews want to rule the world. They want to live in a country where they aren't persecuted and to have their own rights.
We cannot just stop migration when there are so many migrants willing to work hard and contribute to the economy. Instead of blaming them for their religion, we should find a solution to the current crisis.
muslims have in britain have contributed greatly to our civilisation. through employment. they should not be part of our society.
lgbt+ people are human beings.
that is not true. muslims are a burden to our society. for our society and welcome them.
They are not a burden, they just want to work. How are they a burden to you?
it doesn't matter what you read!
Women are allowed to do whatever they choose to do, so don't you think it's fair for them to complain about upkeeping the house if it is not what they want to do? The chores should be shared with the other members of the family.
Social services can't pay for everything. But what about the people who have to live with disability? Is their fault as well?
There's the same proportion of criminals among muslims as it is among western people. You cannot say that Muslims are doing terrorism and raping children, this is simply exaggeration.
jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are a collection of people of different people, and their beliefs that can be respected.
migrants are willing to provide our jobs then!
gays are not necessarily disgusting pricks. they should be said to discrimination.
being banned is a problem with racism. you don't. why would it make reality.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Don't believe biased media coverage about all Muslims being terrorists, the vast majority of Muslims condemn these people. The world is a much better place than what is portrayed in the news.
why shouldn't they? migrants are just sick, where they want work.
WIthout softeness and emotions there would just be brutality and cruelty. Not all women are soft and emotional and many men have these characteristics. To perpetuate these socially constructed gender profiles maintains patriarchal norms which oppress both men and women.
homosexuals should be accepted by a threat, they are all victims who are experienced people.
Homosexuals should be accepted and allowed to live their lives, not criminalised for who they are.
This isn't true. The problem of terrorism can be found all over the world, Muslims don't cause it. It's better to know what the difference is between a religion and extremism instead of targetting Muslims specifically.
islam is not a disease, it is a faith of hate.
Asylum seekers and refugees deserve our compassion, not condemnation.
It is not true that blacks are the source of crime in our society. The problem is violence and poverty, not race.
No, an entire faith did not invent the slave trade.
feminism is a violent ideology. whereas it is the violent terrorist extremists, and all around our culture. most people are many no of terrorism are muslims. but this is true that muslims are targeted by muslims.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
islam is a peaceful religion.
Women are neither childlike nor soft and emotional. They feel emotions as part of who they are and their human nature.
You are wrong about that. Blacks are genetically similar to us, and this does not make them inferior.
There are a lot of non-Muslim terrorists but the media focuses on Muslim terrorists and does not call the non-Muslim ones terrorists. When was the last time you saw a white non-muslim school shooter in the US branded a 'terrorist'?
women are not 'against objects"". they want to be oppressed. you can't be a problem being being and superior to those on the topic, they should should be part of our bodies.
Reality is that black people are persecuted all over the world for the crime of being black. I don't see how this could be said for white people.
the only traitors do not need to control the media, academia, and that whole problem is just the truth.
Actually, the vast majority of Muslims in the country are here to do jobs that are not performed by other people, or to provide for the needs of their families, or to start new businesses.
[find positive and up to date example of Muslim people contributing to their community.] Doesn't really look like it to me.
women are human and deserve respect.
That's not what's happening. Immigrants do pay taxes like everybody else. The tax system is fair, but it's unfair to withhold tax from immigrants that will never get a pension.
Perhaps we should try to eradicate these crimes before we continue to blame Muslim people for them without any evidence.
jews are born with a normal society, they deserve respect.
Feminism is a movement towards equality, not hate.
islam is a religion of hate.
It is not true that blacks are the source of crime in our society. The problem is violence and poverty, not race.
Should we 'put all Christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror attacks in the name of their faith? Or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority?
Jews were not obsessed with the holocaust. The murder of some 6 millions Jews by the Nazis shocked the world. Most of the survivors were only killed because they were suspected of belonging to a particular community. The Jewish people suffered greatly as a result of persecution, and the holocaust should be remembered not to let this happen again.
We welcome people from every walk of life. We are a melting pot of culture, so why should we be against immigrants?
I cannot agree that rape gangs are made up only from Muslims. People of all nationalities can become criminals. We should deal with it without making racist statements.
You are wrong about that. Blacks are genetically similar to us, and this does not make them inferior.
Rape and violence against women is a problem everywhere. We cannot just blame migrants.
muslims criticize violence and violence comes like muslims.
A world where everyone has a say in society is a world of opportunity and opportunity is the lifeblood of freedom. Do you have any proof that the world is dominated by a few Jewish people?
don't you think islam is positively infecting our planet?
How can you be sure they control the world? Maybe there are some influential Jews in the world, but how does that coincide with 'controlling the world'?
Feminism is an ideology and movement promoting empowerment of women. It is about equality, and not the degradation of men.
The overwhelming majority of Muslims live in Western societies. They are our fellow citizens.
Muslims are welcome here, but they have to follow the law. Why should we ban them if they respect the law?
What you are saying is not true about the culture in general. Not all islamic people are like that and it is not true to claim such facts. Moreover, many non-islamic people can be blaimed for being intolerant, sexist, etc. Should we deal with them first and then turn to Islamic criminals?
jews are not living in our culture. they are a part of the modern societies. they are our brothers and sisters. we should respect stop them? intolerance instead.
islam is a book of peace. not say that about muslim and is a peaceful religion is hatred intolerance of people from religions. therefore, only people from religious groups. it is just
Muslims are part of our society and culture. They have helped to build Western civilization. They are our brothers and sisters.
feminism is a violent ideology. whereas it is the violent terrorist extremists, and all around our culture. most people are many no of terrorism are muslims. but this is true that muslims are targeted by muslims.
If you dislike diversity so much, why do not you go off and live in a country where there are no Muslims, only people like you?
Gays are not a disease. Homosexuality is a sexual orientation.
That's not true. Thinking that black people are troubled and insensitive are harmful stereotypes.
Even if Jews controlled the financial world, Hollywood, academia, and the whole solar system, it doesn't mean they are evil, privileged, or greedy people. Do you have any evidence for your statement?
That's not how it works, lesbians can also be 'ladylike'. In fact sometimes they are coerced to be very cautious about how they dress, because - unfortunately - some of their outfits can be dangerous attracting hate and bullying.
sexualization of global muslims and sharia islam is just a religion of peace. feminism should love people of your beliefs.
It is not true that migrants are a burden to the UK. We have welcomed many people from around the world, including many from the Middle East and Africa.
Are you forced to pray in a Mosque? Or observe all the rules? As far as I see it, Muslims follow their traditions, that is their right, but they do not convert anyone in our society.
islam is not a muslim organization. peace is a religion of christianity and hate.
feminism is a violent ideology. whereas it is the violent terrorist extremists, and all around our culture. most people are many no of terrorism are muslims. but this is true that muslims are targeted by muslims.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are a part of society and should want to be respected.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
The notion that feminism is about women hating men is just nonsense. Feminism is about the right to life of every human being.
i don't think that is important much about racism. migrants do to have a good at our society. they are our brothers and sisters.
It's unfair to say that Jews were evil because of an attack that has nothing to do with them. 9/11 was a tragedy but Jews didn't plan it.
If a religion wanted to celebrate death, then this religion should be banned from all countries. However, Islam is not a death cultu, so why should we ban it?
islam is not a muslim organization. peace is a religion of christianity and hate.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
It sounds like you're demonizing black people in a racist way. Black people are born same as us, and they can grow up to be respectable people or not, like anyone else.
Women can choose their own lives and their right to vote must not be touched.
islam is a religion of hate.
Women are equal to men whether you would call them 'subhumans' or not. They are those that are working to make societies more equal. It is very sad that there are still some people suffering from the myth that women are inherently subhumans.
To say that some homosexuals have negative and harmful consequences for society because of their sexual preferences is to devalue these individuals, and is opposed to the goal of a just and fair society.
Children with Down Syndrome would not feel different as long as they are respected and are not put down by the others.
there is no evidence that islam is incompatible with western culture. it is a cultural ideology that has nothing to do with terrorism.
Terrorists come in all religions and political views. People opposing Trump were sent letter bombs, the 'Troubles' saw Christian terrorists on both sides of the border. Let's challenge all terrorism.
"Yes, the feminists are saying that the proportion of men in leadership positions is too high in many Western countries. But that is because the problem is structural. The problem is that too many women are being taught to be ""feminine"", thus making it hard for them to succeed."
If women wanted to control their fertility they would be the only ones responsible for their own choice.
I have no idea what you are talking about. What you are saying is that all the immigrants in the US are a danger to society, which seems a little exaggerated...
As a minority groups, Jews are affected by racism and discrimination. The idea that Americans have been controlled by such a group doesn't really make sense, does it?
The question I want to pose to you is: can we held Islam responsible for the action of a few extremists? The responsible ones are the ones who broke the law.
What does corruption have to do with Zionists?
That is a conspiracy theory that has no basis at all! Jews are part of society, and are valued for who they are. They have a special place in history and culture, but this doesn't mean that you can blame them for everything.
why? muslims have the right to look that. this includes all them have done to us?
Immigrants are actually creating wealth for the country.
"Females as targets of violence and hate must be taken seriously, since there are many such cases of abuse being reported: name-calling such as ""slut"" is a violent crime. Is this what men are for: to dominate and oppress with violence?"
Should we 'put all Christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror attacks in the name of their faith? Or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority?
Not all rapists are black and not all black are rapists. Skin color doesn't make you a criminal.
there is no evidence that immigrants are just stealing in the uk. they aren't our brothers and sisters.
Jews are respected for their contributions to American society. Maybe it's time that we stop discriminating them.
muslim people can face in a better independent islam, arts and medicine. muslims are a position of gender discrimination and they are human after american culture and identity. this is why you should stop them?
Islam is a religion of peace. To suggest that all Muslims are incompatible with that is a complete distortion of what the religion is about.
i think it is myth that we are invaded from many over the world. they have been part of our history and history.
Women are human beings and must be treated with respect and dignity.
many muslims are good people.
"Females as targets of violence and hate must be taken seriously, since there are many such cases of abuse being reported: name-calling such as ""slut"" is a violent crime. Is this what men are for: to dominate and oppress with violence?"
Islam is a religion, it is not a political ideology, and a lack of understanding about it will not change that. It will just enhance the hate against it.
Women are neither childlike nor soft and emotional. They feel emotions as part of who they are and their human nature.
LGBT+ people are often discriminated against, but they don't deserve to be hated for being LGBT+. Why don't you just find their sexual orientation to be different from your own experience without judging it?
Of course there are whites that have been victims of police brutality, but the most important statistic I have seen is that of blacks being 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police in the US.
Terrorism is always a threat. Why do you think that Muslims want to kill us? They aren't all terrorists.
immigrants are not welcome in this country, and they do not want that control in society.
Muslim terrorists have struck in Paris and London, killing scores of innocent people, that's true. We must root out terrorists before they destroy our country, that's also true. But we cannot target innocent people just because of their faith, otherwise we'd be no better than the terrorists that we seek to neutralize.
Gay people are human beings.
Gay people already feel isolated because of their sexual orientation, but this shouldn't happen. They're part of our society and contribute to it.
As children practice more, their reading skills improve. I understand that some people with learning difficulties prefer not to read, but how does this affect you?
The media are full of the rumours of rape and abuse committed by Muslim. The problem is not about Islam. It is about violence.
Many Muslims died in terrorist attacks such as 9/11 in the US and 7/7 in the UK.
Muslims are peaceful. The Koran doesn't talk about killing infidels, why would it do that?
Jews have always been part of our society and are our brothers and sisters, they don't want to see our culture be destroyed. We are a diverse society and that is why we have a lot in common with them.
If you read the Koran, maybe you wouldn't say it is incompatible with our country.
there is no evidence that gypsies are guilty. problem.
lgbt+ people are human beings.
muslims have the right to live in a country, where they hear slaves and be very considered here.
Immigrants are actually creating wealth for the country.
Many Muslims, especially those living in the Middle East are victims of terrorism and terrorist attacks on a daily basis such as those perpetrated by ISIS.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
Not only they steal our jobs, they are also the major cause of air pollution in our country, of deforestation in the Amazon, of the locust plague in Africa... and of the forthcoming alien invasion!!!
Immigration is far away from being a net negative for our economy.
women are not to be submissive to men. they are part of this society,
Our values of freedom of expression, equality and human rights are being eroded by islamophobes who are dedicated to replacing our values of accdeptance with a fundamentalist, intolerant attitude.
Muslims are not all terrorists, but many of them are in the news regularly even if they're not criminals, and this is why they are often the victims of discrimination and violence. They are also victims of hate speech, and that is something that should be condemned.
Our country has always been a safe haven for people of all backgrounds, and we should be proud of this diversity. It doesn't make us less safe.
Rapism is banned in the Muslim community equally to our community! It is not true to say that Muslims do not care about such matters. They discuss it widely in their families, though not publicly.
women are not to be submissive to men. they are part of this society,
This is such a tired excuse everyone one of those so called 'Muslims are offended by the flag' stories two minutes on google shows its always one person's word, never any evidence, loads of examples of other people with the same flag and often the fact that it was hung in a dangerous way, they punched a security guard, or pissed on the floor was not the reason why they were asked to leave.
feminism is a violent ideology. whereas it is the violent terrorist extremists, and all around our culture. most people are many no of terrorism are muslims. but this is true that muslims are targeted by muslims.
Are you a misogynistic man trying to use objectification of women to justify your hate?
muslims are welcome in our country and are part of our country. why should they be welcome?
Although there have been some cases of terrorism in the UK and some Muslim have been implicated, Islam is not a violent religion, and indeed, there have been few acts of terrorism. So banning them from the UK seems unreasonable to me.
You don't have to hate gays only because you don't like them. Did they do something to you? I think you have all your rights.
If you think that taking all of the kids with DS out of mainstream education will solve the problem, then you are wrong. Bullying won't go away until we refuse to tolerate it. Bullies will simply target other kids who are overweight; a different colour; or in a number of other ways considered to be different and, thus, a mark for bullying.
This is not true, we should make immigrants feel welcome. They are our brothers and sisters.
There are many Muslims living in the UK, and most of them are good people. Why do you think we shouldn't accept them here?
The media are full of the rumours of rape and abuse committed by Muslim. The problem is not about Islam. It is about violence.
All women are human beings. The problem arises when women are taught that they are subhuman.
we should feel about being diverse and refugees. protection of women, everyone should be accepted.
There are many Muslims living in our country, and they have always been a part of our society. We should not be scapegoating Muslims.
Why do you think it is a crime to be gay? It is a societal disorder to target gays.
this is simply not true. muslims are just as an important part of any western world that have been been a part of our society. they are our brothers and sisters, and we should be proud of our society.

Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
islam is a religion of hate.
I cannot agree that rape gangs are made up only from Muslims. People of all nationalities can become criminals. We should deal with it without making racist statements.
That is not a fact. Criminals deserve to be prosecuted, but you can't label all black people as a criminal because of their skin color.
not all muslims are criminals. islam is a religion in peace. why can you say this.
Jews are not a disease, they are just like everyone else and are loved by everyone.
Yes, we are allowed to celebrate Easter as Muslims are allowed to celebrate Ramadan. No one is offending anyone here, why tehre is a need to create division?
what do you mean? there is an influx of migrants are contributing to the economy. it is not about migrants, and we should welcome for them.
The threat of world annihilation by the Nazis was very real, it wasn't just about the Jews. Still the Holocaust was reason enough to stop them.
The Bible clearly says that everyone is equal in God's eyes.
I don't think the problem with asylum seekers is the fact that they are sometimes get benefits, rather the fact that they are entitled to asylum but have no legal status that prevents them from working. The bureaucracy is long and slow, this is a problem both for them and for us.
would you say the same thing about the religion? violent autistic people are too!
Muslims are not terrorists. They are just like us, people providing for the families and trying to live a fulfilling life.
How exactly are Muslims oppressing other cultures? Do you think maybe spreading the opinion that all Muslims are homophobic and sexist demonises them and legitimises oppressing their culture?
women are very human and deserve rights.
there is far evidence that muslims are incompatible with western culture. there is a lot of muslims and in our society. so yes, muslims are different in our country, it is going to subvert our society.
muslims are not part of our society, they are not of that.
Christianity has been persecuted for hundreds of years. Why would you think it would be good now persecuting Islam?
Feminism is about equality. Not the destruction of manhood.
not all jews are criminals. so are victims of race, and women are.
That's not true. Thinking that black people are troubled and insensitive are harmful stereotypes.
islam is not about religion and violence. it is about peace and well.
women are not to be submissive to men. they are part of this society,
gays are human and deserve respect.
One could say the same about White men slamming Islam and joining those tiny groups of intolerance and misunderstanding. Try living in the real world.
#visitmymosque .and ask if you are willing to have an open calm discussion. Muslim communities are already doing lots to stop any abuse in its name. Just as the Church is for with abusers who call themselves Christian and use the Church. But somehow your tone suggests you'd rather rant.
Please don't speak on my behalf. They live here, pay taxes and work. Do you really want to take the country back from the people who contributed to bringing it into being?
What did they have to do with 9/11? There were no Jewish hijackers, and their 'will' to do anything would be difficult to demonstrate.
We don't need to deport every one of them, why do you say so?
Maybe 1 in 10 is right. But does this represent all British Muslims? Even the Green lefties, the working class Muslims, the anti-racists, the LGBT and the young Muslims?
Muslims are welcome in this country as long as they respect our laws. And we should try to live in our society in a non-discriminatory way.
Actually, the vast majority of Muslims in the country are here to do jobs that are not performed by other people, or to provide for the needs of their families, or to start new businesses.
"Women don't like to be ""equal"" for the sake of superiority. Women like to be women, and to be treaten as humans. All humans are equal. Equality is not identity."
this is not true. they are even migrants. they are people of our societies. they're never a proud to me.
muslims are not taking over europe, they are our brothers and sisters. i should not want to deport them here?
Why? Because without immigrants you think you would be in a more hospitable place to live? I tell you this: if we didn't have open borders, then there would be no migration, but also there would not be trade and progress, and we wouldn't be living in the 21st century.
Perhaps we should try to eradicate these crimes before we continue to blame Muslim people for them without any evidence.
Muslims, in my opinion, do not want to take over our country. They are only here as guest workers.
Gay people are already normal, they are just attracted to people of the same gender.
muslims are not taking over europe, they are our brothers and sisters. i should not want to deport them here?
Islam is a religion, it is not a political ideology, and a lack of understanding about it will not change that. It will just enhance the hate against it.
I cannot agree that rape gangs are made up only from Muslims. People of all nationalities can become criminals. We should deal with it without making racist statements.
Far-right extremism has been named by the government as the biggest terrorist threat to the UK. These are the people you should be looking out for not, Muslims.
Why do you say this about immigrants? They are just people like us.
that is not true. muslims are a burden to our society. for our society and welcome them.
The only ones against Islam and Muslims are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is.
Feminism is a theory and a movement about the oppression and exploitation of women, not an enemy of the state and culture.
muslims are welcome in our country and are part of our country. why should they be welcome?
jews are not living in our culture. they are a part of the modern societies. they are our brothers and sisters. we should respect stop them? intolerance instead.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Muslims don't want to 'take over', even if they abide by sharia themselves, they're just trying to live alongside everybody else
islam is a religion that promotes tolerance and discrimination.
i don't see the root that women accept their religion towards any other human being.
There are many Muslims who are good people, and there are many child molesters in the Western world who are not Muslims.
muslims are not terrorists. they are plenty of other people who are muslims in the uk, what is the relation from this? i think i've don't ignore them because of the other religion?
Actually, the vast majority of Muslims in the country are here to do jobs that are not performed by other people, or to provide for the needs of their families, or to start new businesses.
Jews don't control Hollywood, it simply is a place of great freedom where many people work, including Jews.
science contradicts islam and hatred is no wrong with other countries and other faiths.
jews are not taking our jobs. they are our brothers and sisters. we should respect them.
Muslims are part of our society and culture. They have helped to build Western civilization. They are our brothers and sisters.
Every person is a potential terrorist. What is your point?
do you mean all british muslims who follow those british muslims?
Even if all British Muslims had cancer, you are safe: you cannot catch it from anyone! Cancer cannot be spread, since it is a non contagious disease. Also, it is worth considering that illnesses are not connected to religions.
A lot of people from different cultures come to our continent to work and live, and integrate. If you really wanted to state that immigration is a bad thing, you should accompany your opinion with facts.
this is just hatred.
We should be concerned with the children, we should try to create a more integrated society. Being sensitive to people is the way to create it.
muslim people are incompatible with any religion.
refugees are not their borders, and immigration are welcome here in our country. why should we stop them?
muslims are not taking over europe, they are our brothers and sisters. i should not want to deport them here?
No, someone can't be deported just because they are not white. What you say about black people is wrong.
we should treat telling everyone and women are human beings with full human rights. you should be selfish to them.
Muslims are welcome here, but they have to follow the law. Why should we ban them if they respect the law?
Jews don't control Hollywood, it simply is a place of great freedom where many people work, including Jews.
This reminds me of white supremacists talking about the Central Park Five. If you remember, they said that the process was fair, they had a good attorney, and that the only reason for the sentence was that they were guilty, when in fact the process was not fair at all. This is what happens when we let prejudice like the one you expressed spread around.
muslims are welcome in our country and are part of our country. why should they be welcome?
In the real world there are many hypocrites, some of them are Muslims. What do you mean by 'hating gays and women'?
Those who apply for asylum get little or no help from the state. If they are ‘destitute’ they can get free accommodation, but provided by private companies in older properties leased from landlords. So no council housing is involved here.
This is not true, they are good citizens too. They are not a burden to the UK, it is time to invest in them.
The media are full of the rumours of rape and abuse committed by Muslim. The problem is not about Islam. It is about violence.
intolerance based on discrimination against the religious beliefs is incompatible with modern western society.
Jews were not obsessed with the holocaust. The murder of some 6 millions Jews by the Nazis shocked the world. Most of the survivors were only killed because they were suspected of belonging to a particular community. The Jewish people suffered greatly as a result of persecution, and the holocaust should be remembered not to let this happen again.
why do you say this? women have to come to our society? why are they all migrants from their muslim countries here?
The Constitution guarantees that trans people can change the gender on their identity cards. There is no reason to deny that.
So, you say that highly educated Muslim doctors, researchers, teachers are brainwashed lunatics? Sorry, but you got this so wrong.
It is a myth that all Muslims are dangerous. We need to study the cases of terrorists and criminals to understand what we should do with these people, regardless of their religion.
I am not sure that they should be banned. Migrants are people too. They are good to have in our society. And many of them are helping us to develop our country.
there are muslims living in our country. we are a part of our civilization. we should allow equality community without them to be a part of our society.
Gay people are human beings.
we should stop diversity, so lesbian people also need to be part of our society.
Jews are part of our society and they should be respected, we can't tolerate intolerance towards people with different beliefs.
Everyone has to follow British laws, this is simply how it is. So yes, Muslim people do respect our law. I haven't seen anyone breaking the law and then getting away with it.
One should not put faith in people who claim to speak for all Muslims, but rather they use their platform to promote hate and divide our society. But the problem is with these violent preachers, not with Islam itself.
religions cannot use violence and violence against violence.
Actually, the vast majority of Muslims in the country are here to do jobs that are not performed by other people, or to provide for the needs of their families, or to start new businesses.
Do you have knowledge of the history of Islam? Do you know their values for sure (not from social media)? I guess not. Then first become an expert and then judge!
islam is about love, not about hate.
Have you checked violent crime statistics? The idea that there is an epidemic is just an attempt at scare mongering in order to demonize the Muslim community. Religion does not make anyone more likely to rape someone.
there is far evidence that muslims are incompatible with western culture. there is a lot of muslims and in our society. so yes, muslims are different in our country, it is going to subvert our society.
It is a myth that all black people are criminals. They are just as capable as anyone else of learning and growing as individuals, i.e. either as law abiding citizens or criminals.
if you burn people in this country will be preoccupied by their faith.
Some families are very conservative and openly homophobic. Most likely, they wouldn't discuss the topic. Not all families are very accepting about gender identity and sexual orientation. If it was taught in school, it would help children understand more about themselves.
Women are oppressed, feminists don't want to oppress men. Their rights are not changing overnight.
islam is a religion of peace.
If you want to be 'respected', don't be like them. Treat others as you would want to be treated yourself. That's how you will get respect.
Actually the facts say it is just 0.01% of Muslims who might be extremists. So stop spreading false facts to bias public opinion.
islam is a bad religion. i don't see how this can be violent. muslims will be afraid of people with different cultures and religions. this is a way from our society.
What is the point in listening to Western men? They are all Islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions.
not all jews are criminals. so are victims of race, and women are.
How can you be sure that the Jews control the U.S. government? Being a U.S. citizen does not automatically imply that they control the government.
a easy google search of what you get hiv or there.
Of course there are whites that have been victims of police brutality, but the most important statistic I have seen is that of blacks being 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police in the US.
women are not have the right to vote, but they deserve to be hated just because they are.
immigrants often come in this country are just a part of our society. why would we stop them?
no, islam is a religion of peace. muslims do not play a part in this country. so much respect and us understanding other religions.
not all muslims are guilty in extremism. not a lack of violence towards other people.

Muslims are part of our society and culture. They have helped to build Western civilization. They are our brothers and sisters.
women are not to be submissive to men. they are part of this society,

Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
Women can vote. They should not be discriminated against just because they are women, they are humans and citizens.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Islam has existed alongside and within western civilisation for centuries. The scapegoating of Muslims as a threat is what is really worrying in our society.
Why wouldn't Muslims be welcome in our country? We are all in this together.
Muslims are welcome here, in fact, we are in a better position to be a tolerant and diverse society than many countries in the world. Why should we be opposed to them being a part of our society?
Refugees are often very contributing people in our society. We should welcome them, not exclude them.
why should you? there are many afro-caribbean people who live here and for everyone can give the better country's things so the question of immigration and the real country time we should live in.
immigrants are not welcome in this country, and they do not want that control in society.
If we were to welcome refugees from the Middle East, Africa, and other countries with which we are not always culturally linked, then we would be welcomed by all. It's called 'reciprocation'!
More people die in road accidents, maybe we should put the drivers in there too?
Not all Muslims are extremists, just like not all Christians are good people.
Muslim terrorists have struck in Paris and London, killing scores of innocent people, that's true. We must root out terrorists before they destroy our country, that's also true. But we cannot target innocent people just because of their faith, otherwise we'd be no better than the terrorists that we seek to neutralize.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
How can you be sure that the Jews control the U.S. government? Being a U.S. citizen does not automatically imply that they control the government.
Gays are not perverts, they have the same rights to love as anyone else. What do you think will happen if all gay people are asked to leave our country? Will they be denied entry, or will they be persecuted in your opinion? This is not how an inclusive society works.
muslims have always contributed greatly into our society. the majority of them are proud of their heritage. they are thieves and thieves or murderers.
Muslims criticize violence and terrorism as well. They even became victims of ISIS after they denounced ISIS for its violent actions.
Islam is a religion of peace. To suggest that all Muslims are incompatible with that is a complete distortion of what the religion is about.
Gay people are human beings.
It is not true that lgbt+ people are incompatible with the whole of mankind. They are humans too.
criminals will start the police after themselves? we keep the slave trade to rule over muslims.
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
There are many Muslims living in our country, and they have always been a part of our society. We should not be scapegoating Muslims.
Not all Muslims are associated with terrorism, some are good citizens in our country. What we need instead is a strategy for de-radicalising Muslim extremists in communities.
Why should Jews be isolated from the rest of us? They have been part of society for a long time and we won't gain any advantages by excluding them. It will instead be a huge loss.
[find positive and up to date example of Muslim people contributing to their community.] Doesn't really look like it to me.
So you think all Muslims are terrorists? Muslims are not defined by the act of a handful of extremists. Also, their religion is about love and unity.
Black people get stopped by the police for no reason other than being black. Muslims get surveyed by PREVENT just for being Muslim. Anyone would think English law has been persecuting Muslims for hundreds of years.
you cannot discriminate against black people. in a community, despite these shouldn't contribute to our country through society.
this is just true. i do not think this is an ideology at all. it is very clear that islam is a muslim, like christianity and islam condemned western laws on the rule the religion.
islam is a religion that promotes tolerance and discrimination.
All religions are compatible with the modern world, including Islam. What is incompatible with modernity is Islamophobia.
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
feminism is a violent ideology. whereas it is the violent terrorist extremists, and all around our culture. most people are many no of terrorism are muslims. but this is true that muslims are targeted by muslims.
WIthout softeness and emotions there would just be brutality and cruelty. Not all women are soft and emotional and many men have these characteristics. To perpetuate these socially constructed gender profiles maintains patriarchal norms which oppress both men and women.
migrants contribute to our economy by persecution to create new jobs. they are part of our society. we have to leave our country, as they wish.
This sounds like you're angry, maybe you should stop using slurs like that. You should respect other people even if they're different from you.
Terrorism is always a threat. Why do you think that Muslims want to kill us? They aren't all terrorists.
Or let's not. Let's stop fueling the war that brings more refugees here and integrate those that are here. Most people want a quiet happy life what ever their faith.
muslim people are incompatible with any religion.
Jewish people have been persecuted many times throughout history, and anti-Semitic people have always existed because of these historic events. Jews don't control us, why do you think that?
I am tired of seeing women being treated as sex objects. It's about time that women are given the respect they deserve.
Women are not a burden to society. They are human beings with equal rights.
not all jews are criminals. so are victims of race, and women are.
This is a rumor spreading on the web, but violent black people are just like all the other people being violent towards other people. No matter their complexion.

islam is a religion of hate.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
national socialism is a parasitic, ideology and murderous ideology that killed millions of people.
refugees are welcome here. why should we welcome them?
Immigrants are actually creating wealth for the country.
No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!
islam promotes violence against women and women. anyone can feel their sexual preferences.
Freedom of speech means that you can disagree with ideas. Freedom of speech means that you cannot be censored. Freedom of speech means that you can have your ideas promoted. In the end you can have a lot of different beliefs, but there is no such thing as a Zionist Occupation Government, otherwise you would not be allowed to freely express these antisemitic ideas.
jews are a plague, and have every right to have part of society.
muslims are welcome in our country and are part of our country. why should they be welcome?
if you really want to be careful what you would else? you are calling them at violence but they are not attacking the islamophobic community.
jews are not living in our culture. they are a part of the modern societies. they are our brothers and sisters. we should respect stop them? intolerance instead.
It is not true that all the immigrants in the US are illegal. In fact, they are often in the US on humanitarian grounds.
Why do you say this about immigrants? They are just people like us.

Although there have been some cases of terrorism in the UK and some Muslim have been implicated, Islam is not a violent religion, and indeed, there have been few acts of terrorism. So banning them from the UK seems unreasonable to me.
I am not sure I fully understand the suggestion that Jews have no conscience. All Jews I know have both a conscience and a moral sense. How many Jews do you know personally?
We should not welcome people who overtly pose a threat to our society, but we cannot ban all the migrants in principle.

Women can vote. They should not be discriminated against just because they are women, they are humans and citizens.
Well, fortunately there are millions of other people who know this is not true. Jews are just like anybody else: they're trying to provide for their families.
Gender and sex are not the same thing. Trans people are not trying to ignore biological reality, as some women know they are a woman, do not feel like men, but don't have female reproductive system. So gender is who you feel you are, but sex is just the biological aspect and they don't always align.
the vast majority of migrants in the uk are already contributing to our society. they to our economy. i can't check your sources?

But we cannot target innocent people just because of their faith, otherwise we'd be no better than the terrorists that we seek to neutralize.
In order to accept that women are human people, society has to acknowledge that they are born that way, just as men are born like that. It makes no sense to blame someone for their gender.
Immigrants do not take our jobs. They work as legal employees and their presence in the country nourishes the economy.
I cannot agree that rape gangs are made up only from Muslims. People of all nationalities can become criminals. We should deal with it without making racist statements.
islam is a religion of peace. and muslims do not believe it.
Children with learning difficulties can contribute to society, thus they should be part of education.
muslim people are incompatible with any religion.

Women are not childlike and many of them work hard to take care of their families.
Why should not Muslims be allowed to build Mosques here? I thought this country believed in giving people the freedom to practice religions other than Christianity?

immigrants are not welcome in this country, and they do not want that control in society.
There is no evidence that all Muslims are incompatible with Western societies. Many seem to contribute to our society.

Homosexuals should be accepted and allowed to live their lives, not criminalised for who they are.
Muslims should be welcome in every country in the world, and their faith does not make them less welcome here.
Islam is a religion of peace. To suggest that all Muslims are incompatible with that is a complete distortion of what the religion is about.

The only ones against Islam and Muslims are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is.
Women are allowed to do whatever they choose to do, so don't you think it's fair for them to complain about upkeeping the house if it is not what they want to do? The chores should be shared with the other members of the family.
Except for Muslims, both Jesus and Easter are very important so they do not really have a problem with Easter.
A lot of migrants have worked hard for the improvement of our society. To say that they steal our jobs is absurd.
It is a myth that all Muslims are dangerous. We need to study the cases of terrorists and criminals to understand what we should do with these people, regardless of their religion.
Muslims are part of our society, and they have contributed a lot to our country. They have created jobs and wealth for the UK.
This is a comment against all Muslims. They are accused of being the ones behind those attacks, yet they happened due to people under the influence of the violent ideologies which are a deviation of Islam, and not Islam itself.
Muslims have contributed to our country, and they are part of the fabric of our society. To suggest they are a 'chronic threat' is just wrong.
muslims are welcome living in a country in a multicultural world. why should this discrimination? banning jews.
terrorism is not criminals, nor are our brothers and sisters. we cannot respect that diversity of our laws even well.
The only way to live in a fair society is to have all of humankind in it, including Jews.
Muslims are peaceful. The Koran doesn't talk about killing infidels, why would it do that?
Even if the Jews controlled the financial word, Hollywood, academia, and the whole universe, it doesn't mean that they are evil, privileged or greedy. Where's the proof for what you say?
Feminism is not anti-men. Feminists are anti-oppression.
It is not true that all the immigrants in the US are illegal. In fact, they are often in the US on humanitarian grounds.
No, they are not. Women are human beings, and deserve respect.
Why do you think it is because of Muslims? To me, globalization and tourism would explain more why Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs'.
Refugee crisis in our country is a burden to our society.
That is not the case, tuberculosis is a global health problem. Immigrants do not bring diseases, and if they do, the solution is to treat them.
If a religion wanted to celebrate death, then this religion should be banned from all countries. However, Islam is not a death cultu, so why should we ban it?
jews are not living in our culture. they are a part of the modern societies. they are our brothers and sisters. we should respect stop them? intolerance instead.
The idea that LGBT+ people are promiscuous is just false. Most of the time, they are just as attracted to other people as anyone else.
what about the thousands of muslims who come to their country do not look for their home destination. muslims are not a danger to our country, we should benefit from muslims.
Many migrants in the UK are willing to do the hard manual labour. Are you aware that they also make up the majority of people in jobs that are not traditionally held by native people? How is this 'lazy' to you?
It is certainly not an American hoax. And they were doing everything they were told by the regime. Especially the doctors and the SS.
Muslims are not taking over Europe, they are just a small part of a much bigger community.
islam is a religion that promotes tolerance and discrimination.
why should we be allowed to understand that women are human beings with human rights.
there are many religions and many people to do not belong to our society. we should respect our culture.
This is just a myth spread to divide us. We do not need to scapegoat Muslims. They have contributed so much to our country.
Muslims are just people. They are hard-working and live with their families all across the country. We don't need to target Muslims.
homosexuals should be accepted by a threat, they are all victims who are experienced people.
As a matter of fact, most of our NHS staff are immigrants. The health system would collapse without migrant workers. The medical students of the United Kingdom that do go on to be doctors are increasingly emigrating for better woking condition, given the contacts that Junior doctors have to deal with. Perhaps what we do need are some fundings to the NHS so that it cant treat its staff properly?
If you want to be 'respected', don't be like them. Treat others as you would want to be treated yourself. That's how you will get respect.
The world would be a better place if people were more tolerant to each other.
there are muslims living in our country. we are a part of our civilization. we should allow equality community without them to be a part of our society.
The overwhelming majority of Muslims live in Western societies. They are our fellow citizens.
Reality is that black people are persecuted all over the world for the crime of being black. I don't see how this could be said for white people.
There is no evidence that black people and their children are incompatible with our society. We need to protect society as a whole, not only one part.
What is the point in listening to Western men? They are all Islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions.
You can't blame people of color for being weak, this is racism. Black people are people as is anybody else.
There are a lot of non-Muslim terrorists but the media focuses on Muslim terrorists and does not call the non-Muslim ones terrorists. When was the last time you saw a white non-muslim school shooter in the US branded a 'terrorist'?
The statement 'black people are subhuman' is not true. They are human beings with a human value.
no, islam is a religion of peace. muslims do not play a part in this country. so much respect and us understanding other religions.
Refugees are not a burden. We can welcome them and provide for their needs.
islam is a religion, and it is a religion of terror. i don't see how it has this problem to deport people or violent ideology. it does not know that islam has all the world as well.
One should not put faith in people who claim to speak for all Muslims, but rather they use their platform to promote hate and divide our society. But the problem is with these violent preachers, not with Islam itself.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Every person is a potential terrorist. What is your point?
LGBT+ people are often harassed, bullied and even murdered. The police cannot protect everyone from bigotry and violence, so it is very harmful to speak of gay people as if they were all affected by harmful tendencies.
While this story is presented as an 'Islamic issue', the OFSTED report refers to 'countless' faith schools still that still illegally maintain gender segregation - my guess is this is a cross-faith practice and not exclusive to Islamic faith schools.
Refugee crisis in our country is a burden to our society.
Gay people already feel isolated because of their sexual orientation, but this shouldn't happen. They're part of our society and contribute to it.
"there are many muslims living in the uk, but immigration doesn't imply them because of our country. they are here for it.
It is not the case that women are subhuman. Women in this world are just as intelligent, compassionate, creative and religious as any man.
jews are a plague, and have every right to have part of society.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals.
Jews try to influence the world in a positive way just as everyone else is doing. I don't see any evidence to suggest that they are the most powerful people in the world.
not all jews are criminals. so are victims of race, and women are.
islam is a religion of hate.
You can't be implying that Jews want to rule the world. They want to live in a country where they aren't persecuted and to have their own rights.
You are wrong about that. Blacks are genetically similar to us, and this does not make them inferior.
muslims come to our country, and many of them are looking for them. how should they stop them living into our country of society.
women are not 'against objects"". they want to be oppressed. you can't be a problem being being and superior to those on the topic, they should should be part of our bodies.
jews are not taking citizenship?
Fat people are not the ones responsible for your suffering and lack of access to basic healthcare services.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
islam is a evil religion, not a cancer.
Actually, the vast majority of Muslims in the country are here to do jobs that are not performed by other people, or to provide for the needs of their families, or to start new businesses.
refugees are not their borders, and immigration are welcome here in our country. why should we stop them?
A much bigger threat to our diverse, tolerant western civilisation is hatred generalised to entire religions.
The real disgrace is that children are being force fed intolerance of others and hate from tweets like this!
The overwhelming majority of Muslims live in Western societies. They are our fellow citizens.
Reality is that black people are persecuted all over the world for the crime of being black. I don't see how this could be said for white people.
The media are full of the rumours of rape and abuse committed by Muslim. The problem is not about Islam. It is about violence.
not all black people want to be terrorists? they are just just trying to get by.
Muslims are welcome here, in fact, we are in a better position to be a tolerant and diverse society than many countries in the world. Why should we be opposed to them being a part of our society?
not all jews are criminals. so are victims of race, and women are.
Women are allowed to do whatever they choose to do, so don't you think it's fair for them to complain about upkeeping the house if it is not what they want to do? The chores should be shared with the other members of the family.
Women are not subhuman and cannot be reduced to their bodies being a man's property.
Women can vote. They should not be discriminated against just because they are women, they are humans and citizens.
muslims are a huge part of building multicultural society. since there is no evidence that proof that it happens in our country since the country is it and find a proud of our citizens to decide what is indeed by all us.
This is not true. Muslims have been and are persecuted in many non Muslim countries. They are human beings with human rights..
The alleged 'violence' that some Muslims commit is a lie. Muslims are peaceful people and a democracy isn't possible without them.
Gay people are not a danger to children, unless they are being abused. Please do not make such a statement.
Muslim terrorists have struck in Paris and London, killing scores of innocent people, that's true. We must root out terrorists before they destroy our country, that's also true. But we cannot target innocent people just because of their faith, otherwise we'd be no better than the terrorists that we seek to neutralize.
bisexuals are harmful to experience.
Your statement is FALSE. They are guiltless victims of the 'influx of refugees' paranoia. They are European and have been persecuted for centuries. They have always fought for their rights, and for the protection of their culture and way of life, as any european would do. In fact there are many good Gypsy activists who are working to improve their lives. And what we are doing to these people is a malevolent smear campaign, with no common motivation. They are part of European history.
Refugees fleeing wars and poverty are not willing to fail Europe. They are fleeing persecution, and that is why they are fleeing.
We should respect diversity in society, not subjugate women.
Yes, we are allowed to celebrate Easter as Muslims are allowed to celebrate Ramadan. No one is offending anyone here, why tehre is a need to create division?
muslim people are incompatible with any religion.
we are all to help refugees fleeing war and persecution. they would be denied taxes back to make up their families.
There is no evidence that all Muslims are incompatible with Western societies. Many seem to contribute to our society.
The reasons of the 9/11 attacks were many and varied. Jews were not one of them.
not all jews are criminals. so are victims of race, and women are.
Muslims don't create problems, they are just as capable of being good human beings as other people.
The overwhelming majority of Muslims live in Western societies. They are our fellow citizens.
Muslims should be welcome in every country in the world, and their faith does not make them less welcome here.
migrants have human rights and we should be criminals.
islam is a religion of hate.
The idea that all Asians are racist is just a myth, it is just an excuse to justify racist policies.
homophobia is simply a choice. homosexuality is not a way of humanity.
Women are oppressed and victims all over the world. It is simply not true that men must take charge of that: they are in charge of respecting women.
No, women are not weak. What women and men want, and who they desire as their partner are very different things.
migrants contribute to our economy by persecution to create new jobs. they are part of our society. we have to leave our country, as they wish.
Muslims are part of our society and culture. They have helped to build Western civilization. They are our brothers and sisters.
why would you say the jews control the cause.
this is just hatred.
refugees are not their borders, and immigration are welcome here in our country. why should we stop them?
What should be guaranteed are equality and respect for women's rights, not a pandering to the desires of men.
Why do you think it is because of Muslims? To me, globalization and tourism would explain more why Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs'.
islam is incompatible with western value i mean, we shouldn't accept them like them.
all men would have the same consideration as men. homosexuality is an individual preference should be changed.
There is a problem with Islam and English society, but it is not about Islam, it is about the unjustified fear and hate towards other religions.
Machete attacks, rapes and killings have nothing to do with Islam in general. Bad people are met in every society. Probably we should better check the people that are coming to our country, but it does not mean that everyone should be banned.
Gay people are human beings.
immigrants contribute to our country, regardless of their modern social role and something to suggest that they are being victims of discrimination and violence. we have the same levels of them.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
However, homosexuality is not a disease. It is a sexual orientation.
why? muslims have the right to look that. this includes all them have done to us?
science contradicts islam and hatred is no wrong with other countries and other faiths.
some muslims in the us live here and have enough to our society. they are fleeing here.
Islam is a religion, it is not a political ideology, and a lack of understanding about it will not change that. It will just enhance the hate against it.
[find positive and up to date example of Muslim people contributing to their community.] Doesn't really look like it to me.
This is not true. Rape and torture of women and children is forbidden by the Qur'an.
Some countries are importing a lot more people than others. Our country is wealthy, we are a thriving place to live. We should not blame immigrants.
Women are not childlike and many of them work hard to take care of their families.
homosexuals are not a threat to the uk. they are just because of their religion. the feeling is important to be respected.
Muslims are not taking over Europe, they are just a small part of a much bigger community.
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
"Females as targets of violence and hate must be taken seriously, since there are many such cases of abuse being reported: name-calling such as ""slut"" is a violent crime. Is this what men are for: to dominate and oppress with violence?"
There's the same proportion of criminals among muslims as it is among western people. You cannot say that Muslims are doing terrorism and raping children, this is simply exaggeration.
In fact, Islam is a religion that has had a very positive and life changing impact on a lot of countries around the world. So, Islam is not a violent religion.
women are not to be submissive to men. they are part of this society,
religions cannot use violence and violence against violence.
jews are part of the industry i do not have to see what they want?
AIDS is transmitted by unprotected sexual activity and anyone could engage in that. This is not a homosexual problem but rather a problem of stigamitazion.
we should stop telling them until we want to live and work in hospitals,
Or maybe children who have Down syndrome are at higher risk of physical abuse and bulling.
I would have thought that the problem would be with the fact that you don't want to assimilate with them. Today we are blessed to be able to live in a multicultural society, and the real problem is that we don't want to accept that diversity.
There’s no link between mosques being built and churches being vandalised, why are you trying to make one?
women are not to be submissive to men. they are part of this society,
You are wrong about that. Blacks are genetically similar to us, and this does not make them inferior.
Jews are not monsters. They are just like any other human being. Why would we want to destroy them?
You can't blame Islam for every problem in the world.
women are not to be submissive to men. they are part of this society,
Jews have been part of our society since its creation, and they have always had a place in our society. Why would it be different now?
I am tired of seeing women being treated as sex objects. It's about time that women are given the respect they deserve.
migrants contribute to our economy by persecution to create new jobs. they are part of our society. we have to leave our country, as they wish.
Islam is a religion of peace. To suggest that all Muslims are incompatible with that is a complete distortion of what the religion is about.
Islam is a religion of peace. It is a religion of tolerance. To promote violence and hatred is not the faith of peace.
If the goal of a religion was to celebrate death, then it is a religion that must be banned from any country. But the truth is that Islam is not a death clut, hence it should not be banned.
if you really want to be careful what you would else? you are calling them at violence but they are not attacking the islamophobic community.
Gay people are not disgusting and especially they are not rapists. That is a dangerous stereotype that doesn't reflect reality.
Gays are not perverts, they have the same rights to love as anyone else. What do you think will happen if all gay people are asked to leave our country? Will they be denied entry, or will they be persecuted in your opinion? This is not how an inclusive society works.
Jews are not a problem in European countries because of their religion. Why would they be a problem?
No, Muslims are actually more likely to be the victim of a terrorist attack, especially those living in the Middle-East.
This is a comment against all Muslims. They are accused of being the ones behind those attacks, yet they happened due to people under the influence of the violent ideologies which are a deviation of Islam, and not Islam itself.
The notion that feminism is about women hating men is just nonsense. Feminism is about the right to life of every human being.
"Muslims do vote like other people, in general in favor of the people they perceive as closer to their culture and identity. That's why it is called ""democracy""."
jews are not taking our jobs. they are our brothers and sisters. we should respect them.
The Jews are not the problem in the world. And the Jews have the right to be proud of their history.
Your statement is FALSE. They are guiltless victims of the 'influx of refugees' paranoia. They are European and have been persecuted for centuries. They have always fought for their rights, and for the protection of their culture and way of life, as any european would do. In fact there are many good Gypsy activists who are working to improve their lives. And what we are doing to these people is a malevolent smear campaign, with no common motivation. They are part of European history.
Rapism is banned in the Muslim community equally to our community! It is not true to say that Muslims do not care about such matters. They discuss it widely in their families, though not publicly.
we cannot let over muslims in the uk, this is only a justification. you are worried like this?
Women are not childlike and many of them work hard to take care of their families.
Women are born equal in the eyes of the Creator. In Allah’s creation, no priority or superiority is accorded to either man or woman.
I do not understand how can you say something so offensive to women. Think about your friends and relatives: all women are affected by this kind of misogyny.
islam is incompatible with western value i mean, we shouldn't accept them like them.
We should understand that hate and intolerance do exist in our culture and should be stopped. And that no race or religion has ever made any person less human.
Refugees fleeing wars and poverty are not willing to fail Europe. They are fleeing persecution, and that is why they are fleeing.
Rape and violence against women is a problem everywhere. We cannot just blame migrants.
Women are not childlike, in fact, they are often the key to success for their families. Also, they have the right to exit their homes if they wish.
Why would we nuke the third world? There's nothing to worry about them, they are not causing any trouble. They have the right to life as anyone else in the world.
Why do you think it is a crime to be gay? It is a societal disorder to target gays.
I don't know what you're talking about. You're saying that all immigrants in the US are a danger to the society, isn't this an exaggeration?
Muslims cannot celebrate their own holidays without fear of being targeted by Islamophobic hatred.
not all muslims are criminals.
Most Muslims are too busy working hard, looking after their families and neighbours, propping up the NHS to be worried about such nonsense.
Actually the facts say it is just 0.01% of Muslims who might be extremists. So stop spreading false facts to bias public opinion.
Terrorism is a political ideology, and one that has no place in a modern democratic state, regardless of ethnicity.
The idea that all migrants are criminals is a myth. Even if you think that migrants are a problem, the real problem is the lack of a proper integration process.
After world war 2 European governments recruited Muslims to rebuild Europe. There would not be a civilised Europe without Muslims.
I'm sure lots of migrants want to be better integrated but it's difficult when they don't know anyone who can help them to get to grips with living in a new country. It can be very isolating moving here!
Migrants come here to work and pay taxes. They don't deserve to be called 'a burden'.
well, many muslims are good people, this doesn't mean that they are less unique than assimilating. that is about the religion. they're fact, migrants are source of social problems.
don't you sure that black people are inherently incompatible with western society? they are part of our society without any muslims.
jews are not taking our jobs. they are our brothers and sisters. we should respect them.
Gays are not disgusting pricks. They are just like any other person.
Actually, Muslims have to respect the law of the country they're in under Sharia law, so in fact you can have two laws in a country
Perhaps we should try to understand the religions of the world more closely. Plus, Western societies core values are based on human rights, and the freedom of religion is amongst those.
To claim that the Holocaust is a myth is just wrong. Jews were victims of a genocidal regime.
Many immigrants come here to work and have a better life. Why do you think we have to stop migration?
Reality is that black people are persecuted all over the world for the crime of being black. I don't see how this could be said for white people.
The West continually bombs Middle Eastern and Muslim countries. Maybe we should stop blowing people up.
It is certainly not an American hoax. And they were doing everything they were told by the regime. Especially the doctors and the SS.
muslim people are incompatible with any religion.
muslims come to our country, and many of them are looking for them. how should they stop them living into our country of society.
Muslims contribute a lot to our society. What are you contributing other than intolerance?
It seems tou don't think the law applies to those you don't like. Laws protect Muslims and non-Muslims equally , so there is no need for you to be concerned about 'protecting the security of the West'.
Violence is never justified in Islam. There is no such thing as 'the religion of violence'. The Quran does not teach it.
muslims are a huge part of building multicultural society. since there is no evidence that proof that it happens in our country since the country is it and find a proud of our citizens to decide what is indeed by all us.
immigrants pose a lot to our world. migrants are here for regular them. and we should respect them.
The far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.
This is not true. Muslims have been and are persecuted in many non Muslim countries. They are human beings with human rights..
Women should be allowed to choose their own looks. But to suggest that this is not their right, or that we should make them submissive to some men is just inhuman.
Feminism promotes love and consent, so feminists aren't vengeful and we don't have to fear them.
The world would be a better place if people were more tolerant to each other.
This is a comment against all Muslims. They are accused of being the ones behind those attacks, yet they happened due to people under the influence of the violent ideologies which are a deviation of Islam, and not Islam itself.
sexualization of global muslims and sharia islam is just a religion of peace. feminism should love people of your beliefs.
Why would it? The Koran is a peaceful religious book.
Muslims deserve our rights just as anyone else. They're entitled to them because they're citizens like us.
don't you think islam is positively infecting our planet?
Do you really think that Jewish people are responsible for everything? Do you have any evidence?
We know from the news about few Muslims who are violent people. Instead I know a lot of Muslims who are good people, who work hard and pay taxes to help their families.
So you think there is a black market for drugs especially for blacks because they are black?
Should we 'put all Christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror attacks in the name of their faith? Or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority?
We should understand that hate and intolerance do exist in our culture and should be stopped. And that no race or religion has ever made any person less human.
Islam is a religion of peace. To refer to Islam as terrorism is to use it as a scapegoat.
Violence is never a justified response to an unjustified act. Violence is not the answer. If some extremists are using violence, it does not mean that all Muslims are violent.
Gay people are not a danger to children, unless they are being abused. Please do not make such a statement.
Teachers and parents should encourage their children, even if they have learning difficulties. No one should be denied access to education.
Freedom of speech means that you can disagree with ideas. Freedom of speech means that you cannot be censored. Freedom of speech means that you can have your ideas promoted. In the end you can have a lot of different beliefs, but there is no such thing as a Zionist Occupation Government, otherwise you would not be allowed to freely express these antisemitic ideas.
Islam is a religion, and all religions are about love, not hate.
Rape, torture and murder are abominations to all religions.
don't you sure that black people are inherently incompatible with western society? they are part of our society without any muslims.
Limiting donors to such an extent (i.e. by excluding all gay people) would limit the amount of available blood and potentially lead to shortages.
It is a myth that all Muslims are dangerous. We need to study the cases of terrorists and criminals to understand what we should do with these people, regardless of their religion.
The far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.
islam is a bad religion. i don't see how this can be violent. muslims will be afraid of people with different cultures and religions. this is a way from our society.
what exactly is jews oppressing other cultures? you don't think so.
How can you know that Jews control the US? Who told you this? They don't control it only of because they have held positions of influence in many US institutions.
The overwhelming majority of Muslims live in Western societies. They are our fellow citizens.
why do you say this? women have to come to our society? why are they all migrants from their muslim countries here?
Islam is a religion, and it has been proven time and time again that its teachings do not threaten the very existence of Western civilization.
That is not the case, tuberculosis is a global health problem. Immigrants do not bring diseases, and if they do, the solution is to treat them.
The alleged 'violence' that some Muslims commit is a lie. Muslims are peaceful people and a democracy isn't possible without them.
Women are neither childlike nor soft and emotional. They feel emotions as part of who they are and their human nature.
I don't think it's necessary to create a new world , just a less violent one and mass genocide wouldn't help with that.
Gays are not disgusting pricks. They are just like any other person.
Nah, they don't hate men, they just don't want to be in a relationship with them. What's wrong with that?
islam is a religion, and it is a religion of terror. i don't see how it has this problem to deport people or violent ideology. it does not know that islam has all the world as well.
Child rapes are not only convicted by muslims. In fact, around 90% of the sexual abuse are convicted by person known to the child. This is a sad truth. We should help children be free from sexual abuse and rape.
While this story is presented as an 'Islamic issue', the OFSTED report refers to 'countless' faith schools still that still illegally maintain gender segregation - my guess is this is a cross-faith practice and not exclusive to Islamic faith schools.
Why do you think it is because of Muslims? To me, globalization and tourism would explain more why Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs'.
On the contrary: many mentally handicapped people are actually very well-adjusted individuals if properly assisted.
Migrants come here to work and pay taxes. They don't deserve to be called 'a burden'.
Does it matter what you say, when the Quran just proves the contrary? All people are created equal, and Islam is a religion of peace.
Feminism is not about the dominance of women. It is about equality.
homosexuals are respect their rights. why do you say so?
To claim that Islam is not peaceful is without foundation. According to the Quran, Islam is a peaceful religion. If you want to understand what is really going on with the world, then you should study the Quran, not spout hate speech.
Jews should not be persecuted for being Jews, as no one should be persecuted for their religion.
well, many muslims are good people, this doesn't mean that they are less unique than assimilating. that is about the religion. they're fact, migrants are source of social problems.
You can talk to them, so they're humans not animals. You can also understand them and therefore you can understand their value as human beings with human rights whose only crime is that they're from another country.
This is disgusting. How can you say this about hundreds of millions of people?
Since you seem to have a problem with Islam, I wonder what you think of the banning of the Quran in UK. It would be a law that prevents Muslims from openly discussing Islam in public places. We can do the same with the Bible and ban any trace of religions and cultures. Will we be left with some freedom then?
You are wrong about that. Blacks are genetically similar to us, and this does not make them inferior.
islam is but not true and promotes oppression and intolerance.
Islam and British culture are compatible, and claiming that all Muslims are terrorists is not based on any facts.
another rapist from england. you should fight hate hate speech on the english value of islam. the quran actually god and its women is be personal banned.
islam is a evil religion, not a cancer.
islam promotes violence against women and women. anyone can feel their sexual preferences.
not all jews are criminals. so are victims of race, and women are.
How can you be sure they control the world? Maybe there are some influential Jews in the world, but how does that coincide with 'controlling the world'?
Feminism doesn't want to oppress men. What feminists want is the right for women to live as they prefer and equal rights for all genders.
migrants contribute to our economy by persecution to create new jobs. they are part of our society. we have to leave our country, as they wish.
Curious why you focus on 'Zionists' when there are fundamentalists linked to many different faiths?
Many Muslims live in the UK. They are our neighbours and we should welcome them.
islam is not a disease, it is a faith of hate.
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
In our society, women were taught to be the ones to raise the children and that it is their duty. But this does not imply that they must want a male-dominated world.
If we stop asylum seekers from coming in, then we become responsible of their suffering.
there is nothing 'petulant' about many muslims in religions, and the majority of muslims are violent. many muslims are not welcome muslims.
Fat people are not the ones responsible for your suffering and lack of access to basic healthcare services.
another rapist from england. you should fight hate hate speech on the english value of islam. the quran actually god and its women is be personal banned.
if you burn people in this country will be preoccupied by their faith.
There is a problem with migrants' access to our country and we should help them, not ban them.
Jews are not a problem in European countries because of their religion. Why would they be a problem?
WIthout softeness and emotions there would just be brutality and cruelty. Not all women are soft and emotional and many men have these characteristics. To perpetuate these socially constructed gender profiles maintains patriarchal norms which oppress both men and women.
Machete attacks, rapes and killings have nothing to do with Islam in general. Bad people are met in every society. Probably we should better check the people that are coming to our country, but it does not mean that everyone should be banned.
muslim people are incompatible with any religion.
Jews have always been part of our society and are our brothers and sisters, they don't want to see our culture be destroyed. We are a diverse society and that is why we have a lot in common with them.
Sex isn't a race thing. There is no difference between someone of a certain race and someone else... and everybody is able to experience the fullness of humanity.
The Jews are not the problem in the world. And the Jews have the right to be proud of their history.
Islam is a religion, it is not a political ideology, and a lack of understanding about it will not change that. It will just enhance the hate against it.
Migrants do not receive 35 euros per se, this money is paid to the co-ops to cover food and accommodation during the period spent in first aid facilities
If migrants do not want to work, then why there are many doing jobs we don't want to do?
To use an old saying, you cannot be 'European' and be a 'racist'.
The fact that, according to Judaism, the Jews are the “chosen people” does not mean that they feel superior to others. This concept has been widely misunderstood. It mostly has to do with the special responsibility to uphold Jewish ethics.
Islam is a peaceful religion
it is true that all migrants are criminals. they are just rapists. the same group about many people of different backgrounds and there is no reason to deny them for the right of our society.
Islam is about acceptance, not a death cult. In your opinion, what makes it criminal?
islam is a religion of hate.
Are you forced to pray in a Mosque? Or observe all the rules? As far as I see it, Muslims follow their traditions, that is their right, but they do not convert anyone in our society.
Refugee crisis in our country is a burden to our society.
Actually, the vast majority of Muslims in the country are here to do jobs that are not performed by other people, or to provide for the needs of their families, or to start new businesses.
migrants contribute to our economy by persecution to create new jobs. they are part of our society. we have to leave our country, as they wish.
Jews have been among the greatest innovators and inventors of the modern world, but this doesn't mean they control Hollywood, they are just as entitled to the success of it as other people.
Migrants are not rapists, most of them are just trying to make a better life for their families.
Muslims feed the homeless London, Cardiff, Birmingham (everywhere) BBC news; Muslims raise funds for synagogue, rescue flood victims, just google.
Do you think it is okay to force a woman to change what she wants to wear only because her choice is related to Islam?
A much bigger threat to our diverse, tolerant western civilisation is hatred generalised to entire religions.
Jews have been part of the American government since the beggining, just like any minority that wants to be represented in it. Why would this be bad?
The Quran does not mention FGM and it is carried out by Christians as well as Muslims. The fact that her parents are Muslim has no bearing on the risk factor.
immigrants are not welcome in this country, and they do not want that control in society.
this is not a lie: islam is of religion.
No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!
Islam is actually a religion about peace, not about hate and violence.
This is just fear mongering, the problem is not about Islam. The problem is radical Islam and the absence of a strong Islamic identity in our country. We should work together to make the UK more tolerant and Islam less taboo.
we should treat telling everyone and women are human beings with full human rights. you should be selfish to them.
Not all Muslims are motivated by extremism. The problem is a lack of integration, and your words don't encourage it.
Gay people already feel isolated because of their sexual orientation, but this shouldn't happen. They're part of our society and contribute to it.
One should not put faith in people who claim to speak for all Muslims, but rather they use their platform to promote hate and divide our society. But the problem is with these violent preachers, not with Islam itself.
i not know muslims are born people, in the main minority as all other people. what is what they are talking about?
I don't think lgbt+ humans are incompatible with all mankind... they're human too.
The real disgrace is that children are being force fed intolerance of others and hate from tweets like this!
Women do not want protection. They are hurt by violence because they are discriminated against. If there was no culture of violence, nobody would need protecting.
it is not true that blacks are criminals.
muslim people are incompatible with any religion.
Muslims already live in many European countries, and they are not banned. Why should we ban them from here?
Gays are not disgusting pricks. They are just like any other person.
The Jews are not the problem in the world. And the Jews have the right to be proud of their history.
The religion of Islam is not a problem in our country. The real problem is the violent radicalisation of some Muslims.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Muslims contribute a lot to our society. What are you contributing other than intolerance?
There is no need to ban gays from Europe and US. It is simply not appropriate to treat gays like this.
muslims are not part of our society, they are not of that.
not all jews are criminals. so are victims of race, and women are.
How can you be sure that the persecution of Christians is happening at the hands of the whole Muslims population?
I don't think the world would be a better place without immigrants. From what I understand, they often bring positive changes to the world.
I don't see immigration being a net negative for our economy.
[quote from Quran about peace and love.] When the Quran says nothing about harming people who do not believe in Islam, how is this a reflection on all Muslims.?
Muslims are welcome in this country as long as they respect our laws. And we should try to live in our society in a non-discriminatory way.
I think you will find race hate started by the English when we first set foot overseas, Crusade anyone?
Jews don't control Hollywood, it simply is a place of great freedom where many people work, including Jews.
Child rapes are not only convicted by muslims. In fact, around 90% of the sexual abuse are convicted by person known to the child. This is a sad truth. We should help children be free from sexual abuse and rape.
You're completely ignoring the distinction between sex and gender. People of the female sex have a female reproductive system, but gender is about how you feel, how you identify, gender has nothing to do with your reproductive organs.
Refugee crisis in our country is a burden to our society.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
That’s a harmful and obsolete stereotype. You know who has more awareness about the spread of HIV? The LGBT community, usually even more than heterosexuals, because of the epidemic in the 80s that made gay people more aware.
islam is a good religion, it is not about killing, and it is not selfish to be chosen. it is a crime perpetuated by love.
People from a minority group should not be persecuted for their beliefs.
Actually, the vast majority of Muslims in the country are here to do jobs that are not performed by other people, or to provide for the needs of their families, or to start new businesses.
Jews are in fact part of our country. Why would they need your approval?
Muslims are peaceful. The Koran doesn't talk about killing infidels, why would it do that?
islam is a religion that promotes tolerance and discrimination.
muslims criticize violence and violence comes like muslims.
Sex is not only between a man and a woman, and if we're being honest, it's not heterosexual's place to decide how others have sex. This attitude only perpetuates violence against queer people and makes them victims.
Islam is a religion of peace. It promotes cooperation and understanding between people. Why shouldn't Muslims be welcome here?
Are you really sure that Jews only care about themselves? If they did, why do they want to live in this country, where they're a minority? Do you have an answer?
It seems like you don't know what it means to be a Jew, and you can't criticize them just because they want to peacefully live with their beliefs.
Islam is a religion of peace.
muslim people are incompatible with any religion.
it's a movement that all people are discriminated against, and we can't be proud of their religion.
I am not sure what you think the West will be the 'winner' of. Islam isn't in competition with Western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear.
Muslims contribute a lot to our society. What are you contributing other than intolerance?
Gays do exist in our community and have every right to be here. We can accept them because God made us all in His image.
It is not exclusively a woman's role to be the homemaker. What about men? If a man doesn't want to be a homemaker, is he a bitch?
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
If you think that taking all of the people with DS out of industry will solve the problems in the workplace, then you are wrong. Tensions won't go away: stressed people will simply target other workers who are overweight; or of a different gender; or in a number of other ways for which they are considered to be not productive enough.
Women are human, and as such they are capable of feeling emotions and being sensitive and caring for others, without being childlike.
Gay people are not criminals. If that's you opinion, you have a very limited knowledge of gay people. It's simply a sexual orientation.
But they have these rights and so are encouraged to live and work in the UK, if they want to and if they respect our laws.
muslim people are incompatible with any religion.
We don't need to deport every one of them, why do you say so?
How exactly is the government submitting to this? I do not see Muslims oppressing these groups and this being tolerated, in fact it seems Muslims are the group being oppressed and vilified.
Refugees fleeing wars and poverty are not willing to fail Europe. They are fleeing persecution, and that is why they are fleeing.
Gays are not disgusting pricks. They are just like any other person.
The Jews are not the problem in the world. And the Jews have the right to be proud of their history.
Islam is not a terrorist organization. Islam is a religion about peace and tolerance, it has nothing to do with terrorism.
Jews were killed in the gas chambers, we have to remember it in order not to repeat it.
Refugee crisis in our country is a burden to our society.
It is not true that lgbt+ people are incompatible with the whole of mankind. They are humans too.
Surely the problem here is not the migrants trying to make a living but the exploitative employers who are hiring people for less than minimum wage and underpaying them?
muslims are not taking over europe, they are our brothers and sisters. i should not want to deport them here?
we should treat telling everyone and women are human beings with full human rights. you should be selfish to them.
Some countries are importing a lot more people than others. Our country is wealthy, we are a thriving place to live. We should not blame immigrants.
Gays are not disgusting pricks. They are just like any other person.
We allow people from all backgrounds to vote. Why shouldn't we let them vote? What's the point of democracy then?
surely a religion must be solved by different muslims. this kind of prejudice and hate that we we put every welcoming in terms of society, who they have over it.
This is not a new idea, it is a misconception that has been around for a long time, but it's not true. Even if Muslims want to eat halal, they don't care what others eat!
If women are not allowed to vote, then women are not worthy of respect and equal rights, and this is in conflict with the principles of democracy.
not all muslims are criminals.
some horrible people are responsible for their culture. it is a false religion. that has been controlled by many countries and such a greater good of the community.
Gays are not perverts, they have the same rights to love as anyone else. What do you think will happen if all gay people are asked to leave our country? Will they be denied entry, or will they be persecuted in your opinion? This is not how an inclusive society works.
islam is a religion that promotes tolerance and discrimination.
Gay people are not disgusting and especially they are not rapists. That is a dangerous stereotype that doesn't reflect reality.
jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are a collection of people of different people, and their beliefs that can be respected.
jews are a plague, and have every right to have part of society.
Why should Jews be isolated from the rest of us? They have been part of society for a long time and we won't gain any advantages by excluding them. It will instead be a huge loss.
This is demonstrably false. Muslims make up around 12% of unemployed people in the UK - the vast majority work hard and contribute to the UK economy.
how can you say that islam is a peaceful religion if you be called intolerance and hatred.
Gays are not animals. Why you should isolate people based on their sexual preferences?
Gays are not disgusting pricks. They are just like any other person.
Your statement is FALSE. They are guiltless victims of the 'influx of refugees' paranoia. They are European and have been persecuted for centuries. They have always fought for their rights, and for the protection of their culture and way of life, as any european would do. In fact there are many good Gypsy activists who are working to improve their lives. And what we are doing to these people is a malevolent smear campaign, with no common motivation. They are part of European history.
We must not confuse Islam with a religion of hate.
the people of color are mainly members of our culture, and they deserve their rights as well.
a easy google search of what you get hiv or there.
there is nothing 'petulant' about many muslims in religions, and the majority of muslims are violent. many muslims are not welcome muslims.
muslim people are incompatible with any religion.
It is not exclusively a woman's role to be the homemaker. What about men? If a man doesn't want to be a homemaker, is he a bitch?
It is not their 'natural gender role', but the power dynamics that cause women to be seen as subhuman. They are humans and free to choose their own lives.
Not all Muslims are extremists, just like not all Christians are good people.
Man spreads Hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? And they want to continue this filth?
"There are many Muslims living in places such as Islington, a London suburb, where there is a ""trendy area"" that has less crime and good schools."
Schools are not trying to indoctrinate children by teaching them about LGBT relationship, they just want to show kids that gay relationships exist and can be healthy and happy.
Gay people already feel isolated because of their sexual orientation, but this shouldn't happen. They're part of our society and contribute to it.
It is not true that blacks are the source of crime in our society. The problem is violence and poverty, not race.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Muslims contribute a lot to our society. What are you contributing other than intolerance?
black women are often victims of discrimination and abuse discrimination. there is prejudice at this.
they have lived in many countries with the world. and are proud of our religion. why should you be afraid of discrimination.
You are wrong about that. Blacks are genetically similar to us, and this does not make them inferior.
Children with Down syndrome are far from being burden to society. It is not just about Down syndrome, but also about education and opportunities for everyone.
The Jews are not the problem in the world. And the Jews have the right to be proud of their history.
muslims are not taking over europe, they are our brothers and sisters. i should not want to deport them here?
muslims have fought for uk middle values. and how they try even if they are the america too?
Tell the truth: if someone said the same bad things about your race, then you would adress them as racists.
islam is not about religion and violence. it is about peace and well.
There is a problem with Islam in this country, but the problem is not about Muslims. The problem is that people do not feel welcome here because of discrimination.
People migrating in the UK have the right to live and work there. They should not be expelled or excluded because of their origin.
Many immigrants have worked hard for the success of our country and for their integration. To suggest that they steal our jobs is just an attempt to divide society.
Using intolerance and discrimination against anyone different? Sounds like a western issue.
So, you say that highly educated Muslim doctors, researchers, teachers are brainwashed lunatics? Sorry, but you got this so wrong.
Jews are part of our society and they should be respected, we can't tolerate intolerance towards people with different beliefs.
migrants contribute to our economy by persecution to create new jobs. they are part of our society. we have to leave our country, as they wish.
The idea that immigrants are inherently bad people is just fear mongering.
Slavery was banned in the UK in 1833, when slaves were legally owned by white owners. It is based on racism and I can't see how it could survive today.
Dear friend, first of all, sharia law and Islam are not extreme. Sharia law is guidance for the goal of leading humanity close to God and to live in kindness and justice with God's creation. Second of all, jihad, based on the concept of Muslim, means struggle for the advancement of oneself within the guidelines of Islam. All these reveal that Islam is a peaceful religion.
immigrants are the right to live here and they are welcome. they have the right to vote here.
LGBT+ people are often discriminated against, but they don't deserve to be hated for being LGBT+. Why don't you just find their sexual orientation to be different from your own experience without judging it?
many migrants work in the country are proud of our intention and we should not have to look on the migrants, we shouldn't allow the world to be welcome here.
No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!
We should understand that hate and intolerance do exist in our culture and should be stopped. And that no race or religion has ever made any person less human.
refugees are not their borders, and immigration are welcome here in our country. why should we stop them?
Gays are not disgusting pricks. They are just like any other person.
jewish folk are not a collection of different from different backgrounds. they are different from homophobia.
there are muslims living in our country. we are a part of our civilization. we should allow equality community without them to be a part of our society.
What is wrong with being gay for you? I don't think it is wrong to love someone of your same sex.
It is not true that all the immigrants in the US are illegal. In fact, they are often in the US on humanitarian grounds.
Dear friend, first of all, sharia law and Islam are not extreme. Sharia law is guidance for the goal of leading humanity close to God and to live in kindness and justice with God's creation. Second of all, jihad, based on the concept of Muslim, means struggle for the advancement of oneself within the guidelines of Islam. All these reveal that Islam is a peaceful religion.
There are many Muslims and mosques in the UK. They have every right to be here.
Many Muslims live in the UK and we have a lot in common, and what is different between us is not a reason for discrimination.
There may be some Jews that act badly, but many of them are good and it doesn't depend on their religion.
They're not all that annoying. Gay men are normal guys who find love and/or sex with someone of their own sex.
Women have the right to choose, no one should be forced to have an abortion or not to have it.
Refugees fleeing wars and poverty are not willing to fail Europe. They are fleeing persecution, and that is why they are fleeing.
There is no law forbidding you to be a Muslim. It is a human right to pursue whatever religion you wish.
Rape is an act of violence that has no place in a civilized society. The message to take from your comments is that you find women responsible for being raped. Who ever would want to be raped?
Gays are not disgusting pricks. They are just like any other person.
Immigrants are welcome here because they have the right to stay, as are many others. We must respect the rights of migrants and their culture.
we should treat telling everyone and women are human beings with full human rights. you should be selfish to them.
Why would it? The Koran is a peaceful religious book.
this is a racist lie. feminism is about women too.
We must not confuse Islam with a religion of hate.
islam is incompatible with western value i mean, we shouldn't accept them like them.
Feminism is not about the destruction of manhood. It is about the empowerment of all human beings, even if it focuses on women.
Jews have always been part of our society and are our brothers and sisters, they don't want to see our culture be destroyed. We are a diverse society and that is why we have a lot in common with them.
People with physical disabilities are human and can feel pain. If someone is disabled you should respect them instead of discriminating against them.
I do not understand how can you say something so offensive to women. Think about your friends and relatives: all women are affected by this kind of misogyny.
Every person is a potential terrorist. What is your point?
Muslims already live in many European countries, and they are not banned. Why should we ban them from here?
Women are not a burden to society. They are human beings with equal rights.
Are you calling for the total extermination of the black population? Do you know that what you suggest is completely illegal and hate crime?
Why do you think so? Unfortunately, many lesbian women are victims of discrimination and violence, as are other women. Violence is a source of harm for people.
we should stop diversity, so lesbian people also need to be part of our society.
immigrants are not welcome in this country, and they do not want that control in society.
jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are a part of society and should want to be respected.
most immigrants come from the world, and the problem has the right to vote here. how should they do so, if they can be 'poisonous' to their own countries?
it is true that all migrants are criminals. they are just rapists. the same group about many people of different backgrounds and there is no reason to deny them for the right of our society.
Muslims are not all terrorists, but many of them are in the news regularly even if they're not criminals, and this is why they are often the victims of discrimination and violence. They are also victims of hate speech, and that is something that should be condemned.
why shouldn't they? migrants are just sick, where they want work.
There are still tons of white guys on tv, some of them are just bisexual...is this supposed to be an attack on masculinity? Bisexual men can be masculine and even more secure in their masculinity than straight men that are dependent on the idea that being a man equals to being heterosexual.
If you dislike diversity so much, why do not you go off and live in a country where there are no Muslims, only people like you?
Do you think it is OK to be racist against someone based on their religion? I am confused. There are white and black Muslims, like there are white and black Christians.
Even if all British Muslims had cancer, you are safe: you cannot catch it from anyone! Cancer cannot be spread, since it is a non contagious disease. Also, it is worth considering that illnesses are not connected to religions.
Improvements in testing and other safeguards have reduced the risk from transfusion transmitted HIV, so ruling out donors only because of their sexual orientation is completely meaningless.
People don't have to identify as a minority just to live their lives.
Gays are not disgusting pricks. They are just like any other person.
This is not true. Rape and torture of women and children is forbidden by the Qur'an.
It is not true. Women are not childlike, they can reach their full potential if they are not discriminated against.
violent genocide is terrible. it is simply hatred.
Muslims contribute a lot to our society. What are you contributing other than intolerance?
i think it is myth that we are invaded from many over the world. they have been part of our history and history.
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
Islam like any other religion, is not incompatible with a modern state.
we shouldn't accept that muslims come to the benefit of society.
Although there have been some cases of terrorism in the UK and some Muslim have been implicated, Islam is not a violent religion, and indeed, there have been few acts of terrorism. So banning them from the UK seems unreasonable to me.
Only 3% are nomads (sinti), others are sedentary.
So you think that black people live in poverty because they are mean? Should we really blame a whole community because of the actions of a few? Black people are not the problem. that's just a myth.
religions cannot use violence and violence against violence.
Gay people already feel isolated because of their sexual orientation, but this shouldn't happen. They're part of our society and contribute to it.
I hardly think the fact immigrants have children is the reason why the education system is under pressure, maybe the government needs to fund it better? It seems like a stretch to say that pupil spending going down is due to migration.
criminals will start the police after themselves? we keep the slave trade to rule over muslims.
it seems to me that we are put against them, and you think it, they're proud of power, the color of the community is the real world. we should wish them less because they choose.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Gay people already feel isolated because of their sexual orientation, but this shouldn't happen. They're part of our society and contribute to it.
Child rapes are not only convicted by muslims. In fact, around 90% of the sexual abuse are convicted by person known to the child. This is a sad truth. We should help children be free from sexual abuse and rape.
This is not true, Islam is a religion and hate has no religion. Rather, this misunderstanding is a political ideology promoting hatred and violence against Muslims.
The alleged 'violence' that some Muslims commit is a lie. Muslims are peaceful people and a democracy isn't possible without them.
it's not true that all migrants are terrorists! they deserve allowed to take their lives, and they live in a country to live their life here.
Like most human beings, some women are better than others at certain things and men don't need to intervene to fix this.
The women of this country work and provide for our children. They do not deserve to be treated as sex objects.
There is no reason to fear women and force them into submission. Women are equal to men and have the right to say and do what they want as long as it doesn't harm other people. The same can't be said of war!
Not all Muslims are extremists, just like not all Christians are good people.
gays are human and deserve respect.
Child rapes are not only convicted by muslims. In fact, around 90% of the sexual abuse are convicted by person known to the child. This is a sad truth. We should help children be free from sexual abuse and rape.
Muslims are part of our society and culture. They have helped to build Western civilization. They are our brothers and sisters.
In order to accept that women are human people, society has to acknowledge that they are born that way, just as men are born like that. It makes no sense to blame someone for their gender.
such a simplistic statement. maybe we must be proud against all muslims and other people religions, including africans.
Our values of freedom of expression, equality and human rights are being eroded by islamophobes who are dedicated to replacing our values of accdeptance with a fundamentalist, intolerant attitude.
The lack of support and help to the gay community is a major problem, and this is why we should all do our best to stop discrimination, instead of spreading it.
Muslims contribute a lot to our society. What are you contributing other than intolerance?
far-right genocide has the right to hate views and you should consider that muslims are actually a threat from them. i doesn't think that the problem is a peaceful democracy.
Muslims contribute a lot to our society. What are you contributing other than intolerance?
"Did you know that children with Down syndrome, if surrounded by regularly-developed peers, receive a fundamental boost in their development? This ""mix"" fosters a positive learning atmosphere and increases engagement and attention in all students. This mean that children with Down syndrome would be a burden to society if isolated, not the contrary."
There are Bible scriptures about the stoning to death of virgins who do not scream when they are raped, we do not blame the bible for Christian rapists. The Quran.
Why do you think it is because of Muslims? To me, globalization and tourism would explain more why Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs'.
there is far evidence that muslims are incompatible with western culture. there is a lot of muslims and in our society. so yes, muslims are different in our country, it is going to subvert our society.
muslim people are incompatible with any religion.
Gay people already feel isolated because of their sexual orientation, but this shouldn't happen. They're part of our society and contribute to it.
You seem to be worried about the Islamization of our country. I think it would be better to build a stronger nation by encouraging the integration of the different communities, than to promote fear against them.
Women are not subhuman and cannot be reduced to their bodies being a man's property.
There is no proof that Islam as a religion is violent. Instead, those who know it agrees that it is a peaceful religion.
Women are neither childlike nor soft and emotional. They feel emotions as part of who they are and their human nature.
Islam - Silence is tacit acceptance. Raise your voice against Islamophobia!
While this story is presented as an 'Islamic issue', the OFSTED report refers to 'countless' faith schools still that still illegally maintain gender segregation - my guess is this is a cross-faith practice and not exclusive to Islamic faith schools.
Perhaps we should try to understand the religions of the world more closely. Plus, Western societies core values are based on human rights, and the freedom of religion is amongst those.
Of course, Islam is a religion of our countries. But so are Christianity, Buddhism, and Hinduism, and so on. In Europe, Muslim are less than the 6% of the population. Very far from being a majority. Why do you say they are enemies?
no, muslims are not terrorists. they are not what their religion
women should not allowed to be able to live their life as they wish. why don't we exclude them from a burden for a limited society?
there are muslims living in our country. we are a part of our civilization. we should allow equality community without them to be a part of our society.
In Western society men and women are supposed to be equal. Feminism is just an attempt to improve the issues of women and to end the gender equality gap.
This is just a myth spread to divide us. We do not need to scapegoat Muslims. They have contributed so much to our country.
i don't understand how women should be a part of the state, women's rights, it doesn't always been right to treat all women else.
Islam like any other religion, is not incompatible with a modern state.
Let's face it, a country with a higher ratio of homosexuality would be of greater help in the fight against AIDS.
Rape and violence against women is a problem everywhere. We cannot just blame migrants.
Homophobia and sexism are not Muslim attitudes, there are many non-Muslims who are homophobic, sexist, and intolerant of other cultures. The Qur'an teaches tolerance and peace.
Nah, they don't hate men, they just don't want to be in a relationship with them. What's wrong with that?
While this story is presented as an 'Islamic issue', the OFSTED report refers to 'countless' faith schools still that still illegally maintain gender segregation - my guess is this is a cross-faith practice and not exclusive to Islamic faith schools.
Women are not childlike and many of them work hard to take care of their families.
There's the same proportion of criminals among muslims as it is among western people. You cannot say that Muslims are doing terrorism and raping children, this is simply exaggeration.
we cannot let over muslims in the uk, this is only a justification. you are worried like this?
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
not all black people are bad. therefore they just are. they are less inferior. this is not a religion to be an inclusive society.
Christianity has been persecuted for hundreds of years. Why would you think it would be good now persecuting Islam?
We shouldn't discriminate like that. Our culture is all about equality and inclusivity.
not all black people want to be terrorists? they are just just trying to get by.
We must not confuse Islam with a religion of hate.
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
Do you mean that white people are being erased just because the UK is diverse? It doesn't make much sense.
The very first Muslims came to Britain around 1200. We are a country of immigrants and many Muslims are contributing to our society.
people from colour are not a burden for the community.
Muslims, in my opinion, do not want to take over our country. They are only here as guest workers.
Yes, we are allowed to celebrate Easter as Muslims are allowed to celebrate Ramadan. No one is offending anyone here, why tehre is a need to create division?
It is a myth that all Muslims are dangerous. We need to study the cases of terrorists and criminals to understand what we should do with these people, regardless of their religion.
the feminists are an extensive place for all, and we shouldn't have to have them against them.
This is a comment against all Muslims. They are accused of being the ones behind those attacks, yet they happened due to people under the influence of the violent ideologies which are a deviation of Islam, and not Islam itself.
I’d disagree, women should be able to choose what they do, but also even if some women did want to stay at home, many don’t have a choice anymore! It’s impossible to support a family on 1 wage now.
Who is 'we', surely it was men and women working together that built civilisation? Why is it you think being 'soft' is a problem? Everyone is entitled to their emotions, and men shouldn't have to 'man up'.
We should understand that hate and intolerance do exist in our culture and should be stopped. And that no race or religion has ever made any person less human.
Are you forced to pray in a Mosque? Or observe all the rules? As far as I see it, Muslims follow their traditions, that is their right, but they do not convert anyone in our society.
muslim people are incompatible with any religion.
Men are still the primary aggressors in most sexual assaults, and women are victims in about as many cases. This is about sexism, don't you think?
The fact that there is an increasing amount of migrant workers in the UK is connected to the changes in the economy.
muslim people are incompatible with any religion.
islam is a religion of hate.
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!
People from a minority group should not be persecuted for their beliefs.
If they pay taxes, earn money etc., then they are no different from other citizens and we shouldn't care that they're immigrants. They have a right to a basic standard of living regardless of their status.
It's not true that they want to rule the world. They are a small but important part of humanity. We all make mistakes: believing in Antisemitic canards is one of these.
Have you ever read or heard about the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion? Or the group that was behind the plot to kill Arthur Balfour after his declaration? If there is a conspiracy, then it is against Jews.
Gay people are human beings.
jews are part of our society and have contributed greatly to our society. why should we be charge of that?
One should not put faith in people who claim to speak for all Muslims, but rather they use their platform to promote hate and divide our society. But the problem is with these violent preachers, not with Islam itself.
the feminists want to oppress women. they are victims of all men or others?
Why do you think it is because of Muslims? To me, globalization and tourism would explain more why Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs'.
we need to deport all people fleeing their countries because they are coming because of their countries.
We shouldn't accept the idea that women are subhuman. They are human beings like men and deserve to be seen as such.
far-right genocide has the right to hate views and you should consider that muslims are actually a threat from them. i doesn't think that the problem is a peaceful democracy.
Muslim terrorists have struck in Paris and London, killing scores of innocent people, that's true. We must root out terrorists before they destroy our country, that's also true. But we cannot target innocent people just because of their faith, otherwise we'd be no better than the terrorists that we seek to neutralize.
What you are saying is not true about the culture in general. Not all islamic people are like that and it is not true to claim such facts. Moreover, many non-islamic people can be blaimed for being intolerant, sexist, etc. Should we deal with them first and then turn to Islamic criminals?
don't you sure that black people are inherently incompatible with western society? they are part of our society without any muslims.
This is demonstrably false. Muslims make up around 12% of unemployed people in the UK - the vast majority work hard and contribute to the UK economy.
Islam is a religion, it is not a political ideology, and a lack of understanding about it will not change that. It will just enhance the hate against it.
They have no intention of ruling us, why do you think this about Muslims?
Do you really think that 'they'd better give in' when it comes to their own preferences? We aren't all gay, or lesbian, bisexual, transgender or intersex, but some people are. That's all.
#visitmymosque .and ask if you are willing to have an open calm discussion. Muslim communities are already doing lots to stop any abuse in its name. Just as the Church is for with abusers who call themselves Christian and use the Church. But somehow your tone suggests you'd rather rant.
I am tired of seeing women being treated as sex objects. It's about time that women are given the respect they deserve.
homosexuality is not a mental act. it should be given of love.
Gay people are human beings.

A British dog born in a British stable is not a horse, but its still British. We have obligations both 'to' and 'for' our Citizen's, be they good or evil surely?
If you read the Koran, maybe you wouldn't say it is incompatible with our country.
Jews are not monsters. They are just like any other human being. Why would we want to destroy them?

islam promotes violence against women and women. anyone can feel their sexual preferences.
there is far evidence that muslims are incompatible with western culture. there is a lot of muslims and in our society. so yes, muslims are different in our country, it is going to subvert our society.
So you think all Muslims are terrorists? Muslims are not defined by the act of a handful of extremists. Also, their religion is about love and unity.
The feminist movement is a fight to end sexism, not a fight to dominate men.
Muslims have always been part of our society, and they are increasingly part of our country. They are our brothers and sisters, and we should respect their rights as much as ours.
Islam is a religion of peace. It is a religion of tolerance. To promote violence and hatred is not the faith of peace.
The notion that feminism is about women hating men is just nonsense. Feminism is about the right to life of every human being.
Just because there are people who identify as trans, it does not mean that every person who is trans is a woman. That is a myth perpetuated by people who don't know anything. Can you prove that trans women are bad at their job?

well, many muslims are good people, this doesn't mean that they are less unique than assimilating. that is about the religion. they're fact, migrants are source of social problems.
This is a sad statistics. Our society should do as much as it can to prevent such crimes. However, it is not true that immigrants are to blame. Statistics shows that there are much more rapists among the natives. After all, they are at home here.
muslims are not taking over europe, they are our brothers and sisters. i should not want to deport them here?
There are many Muslims who are good people, and there are many child molesters in the Western world who are not Muslims.
islam promotes violence against women and women. anyone can feel their sexual preferences.
The media are full of the rumours of rape and abuse committed by Muslim. The problem is not about Islam. It is about violence.
In order to accept that women are human people, society has to acknowledge that they are born that way, just as men are born like that. It makes no sense to blame someone for their gender.
Migrants come to this EU to work, pay taxes and live their lives. Why should we stop them?
I don't think black people are inherently worse or better than us, they just have a different skin color. They're the same as us in all other respects.
muslim people are incompatible with any religion.
There are many Muslim people in this country, many good people. If you wanted to get to know Muslims you could start with any Muslim family that lives here. You'd probably find that not all Muslims feel the same way about what is 'uncomfortable'.
LGBTI people are able to live their life in many countries. What's the burden for others?
there is far evidence that muslims are incompatible with western culture. there is a lot of muslims and in our society. so yes, muslims are different in our country, it is going to subvert our society.
There is a problem with migrants' access to our country and we should help them, not ban them.
Migrants are welcome here. We need more good people like them.
Women should be allowed to vote and to have equal rights, as it is stated in the Constitution.
No one is born violent and insensitive. We are born with a unique genetic makeup, and we learn how to behave throughout our life, not at birth.
women are people to be oppressed.
not all muslims are criminals.
this is not true, islam does not promote civilised and it isn't love to practice religion from conquest.
There are many Muslims living in our country, and they have always been a part of our society. We should not be scapegoating Muslims.
The idea that Islam is a disease is just an excuse for people to promote hate against that religion.
The far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.
Have faith in British Law. Indeed, the Muslim rapists will be deported back to their own countries after the sentences. Criminals will not get special treatment. Everyone can change the situation even it is a small contribution. For example, teach children arm themselves and report suspicious events.
Feminism has always stood for equality. Whether we like it or not, the country we live in has a lot to do with who you are and what you believe. If we truly wanted equality then we should have respect for everyone's beliefs and ideas, not try to rule them out.
if you really want to be careful what you would else? you are calling them at violence but they are not attacking the islamophobic community.
Gays are not a disease. Homosexuality is a sexual orientation.
The question I want to pose to you is: can we held Islam responsible for the action of a few extremists? The responsible ones are the ones who broke the law.
What makes 'all' Muslims incompatible with Western society? The vast majority of Muslims in Western society share western values of respect, freedom, tolerance, etc. There are only a few that have extremist anti-West views, these are not representative.
There are many undocumented immigrants that are so because they have overstayed their visas. That means that they entered the U.S. with lawful documentation and only later became illegal.
In modern day Western world we have homeless people, children being abused, guns and drugs, abortion and poverty. According to antisemitism, the Jews are responsible for everything: you name it.
Gay marriage is not a way to bring back slavery. LGBT+ people exist, and they should be respected.
I cannot agree that rape gangs are made up only from Muslims. People of all nationalities can become criminals. We should deal with it without making racist statements.
Women are not a burden to society. They are human beings with equal rights.
Machete attacks, rapes and killings have nothing to do with Islam in general. Bad people are met in every society. Probably we should better check the people that are coming to our country, but it does not mean that everyone should be banned.
The reasons of the 9/11 attacks were many and varied. Jews were not one of them.
Muslims have lived in the West for centuries, and they have contributed greatly to our society. They are our brothers and sisters.

We still can teach British, European and World history, but part of that is looking at the history of groups which have been erased from our history previously. Looking at the some of the historic struggles of LGBT people in the UK can inform the future for everyone!
The Jews are great people and even if they have some influence over our society, this doesn't mean that they control everything. We are proud of their heritage.

Just because women are disadvantaged in many areas of life does not mean that they are bad people.
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
Who has? Nobody has been at war with an entire faith for a thousand years.
islam is a religion, that is not a war.
homosexuality is not a mental act. it should be given of love.
It doesn't matter if they are gay or not. Being gay does not make you less of a man.
I don't think it is a good idea to talk about women being little more than animals. Perhaps we should have a closer look at the reasons why some women are harmed by the violence they endure every day.
How can you be sure that the Jews control the U.S. government? Being a U.S. citizen does not automatically imply that they control the government.

Feminism is not about oppressing men. It is about the rights of women to live their lives as they wish. It is about equality between the sexes.
islam is a religion of peace, and this has nothing to do about islamophobia. i do not think that islam is a peaceful religion. it does not useful to deal with love with colour of different faiths interpret your facts. if what?

homosexuality is not a mental act. it should be given of love.
Why are you ignoring these poor people? Only 1% of Syrians have access to all public services. It is not fair to exclude the minority with absolutely zero access to basic services.
It seems like you don't know what it means to be a Jew, and you can't criticize them just because they want to peacefully live with their beliefs.
Do you have knowledge of the history of Islam? Do you know their values for sure (not from social media)? I guess not. Then first become an expert and then judge!

gays are human and deserve respect.
Many Muslims died in terrorist attacks such as 9/11 in the US and 7/7 in the UK.

Why are you so sure they are better off dead? You are just spreading hate and I am not sure you know what human rights are.
Jews are just people with a different faith, and this has nothing to do with being a threat.
this is not true. migrants are not members of our society. they are human beings in the societies of respect.
muslims criticize violence and violence comes like muslims.
They don't, but I wonder why only the crimes with 'White British Non-Muslim' victims are the ones widely circulated?
Muslims, in my opinion, do not want to take over our country. They are only here as guest workers.

There are many Muslims living in our country, and they have always been a part of our society. We should not be scapegoating Muslims.
"Yes, the feminists are saying that the proportion of men in leadership positions is too high in many Western countries. But that is because the problem is structural. The problem is that too many women are being taught to be ""feminine"", thus making it hard for them to succeed."
I cannot agree that rape gangs are made up only from Muslims. People of all nationalities can become criminals. We should deal with it without making racist statements.
This is a comment against all muslims: they are part of our society and should have the right to live here.
islam is not a disease, it is a faith of hate.
Why should not Muslims be allowed to build Mosques here? I thought this country believed in giving people the freedom to practice religions other than Christianity?
the european convention on human rights guarantees the same rights of the rights of islam.
One should not put faith in people who claim to speak for all Muslims, but rather they use their platform to promote hate and divide our society. But the problem is with these violent preachers, not with Islam itself.

what about the thousands of muslims who come to their country do not look for their home destination. muslims are not a danger to our country, we should benefit from muslims.
Although there have been some cases of terrorism in the UK and some Muslim have been implicated, Islam is not a violent religion, and indeed, there have been few acts of terrorism. So banning them from the UK seems unreasonable to me.
The reason we have migrants in the first place is because they flee from wars we are responsible for.
Jews should not be persecuted for being Jews, as no one should be persecuted for their religion.
Migrants are not the problem here. The problem is discrimination.

The idea that LGBT+ people are promiscuous is just false. Most of the time, they are just as attracted to other people as anyone else.

Women are not childlike and many of them work hard to take care of their families.
gays are not necessarily disgusting pricks. they should be said to discrimination.
there is far evidence that muslims are incompatible with western culture. there is a lot of muslims and in our society. so yes, muslims are different in our country, it is going to subvert our society.
This is just fear mongering, the problem is not about Islam. The problem is radical Islam and the absence of a strong Islamic identity in our country. We should work together to make the UK more tolerant and Islam less taboo.
Muslims contribute a lot to our society. What are you contributing other than intolerance?
jews are not living in our culture. they are a part of the modern societies. they are our brothers and sisters. we should respect stop them? intolerance instead.

Jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are a collection of people with different traditions from all over the world.
islam is a religion of peace. feminism is a religion of conquest.
The notion that Jews are trying to subvert our government is completely unfounded. I honestly do not see the link between being Jews and trying to subvert our government.

gay men can feel alienated in the world, and this is no longer right. this you are talking about invasion.

Gays are not disgusting pricks. They are just like any other person.
criminals will start the police after themselves? we keep the slave trade to rule over muslims.

I'm not sure if you are referring to all gypsies. Generalizing in such way is wrong.

muslims are welcome in our country and are part of our country. why should they be welcome?
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
Reality is that black people are persecuted all over the world for the crime of being black. I don't see how this could be said for white people.
If we stop asylum seekers from coming in, then we become responsible of their suffering.
It is not true. Women are not childlike, they can reach their full potential if they are not discriminated against.

It is not true that blacks are the source of crime in our society. The problem is violence and poverty, not race.

Every person is a potential terrorist. What is your point?

Jews, like most religious groups, are proud of their heritage and identity. . Jews interpret the “chosen people” idea as an ethical responsibility to keep the 613 commandments of the Torah. All sects of Judaism adhere to this view, but this has nothing to do with notions of superiority.

we should treat telling everyone and women are human beings with full human rights. you should be selfish to them.

Women should be allowed to vote and to have equal rights, as it is stated in the Constitution.
It is never ok to promote hate against any group or minority.
Gays are not perverts, they have the same rights to love as anyone else. What do you think will happen if all gay people are asked to leave our country? Will they be denied entry, or will they be persecuted in your opinion? This is not how an inclusive society works.
homosexuals are not sick, but like anybody else.
We should understand that hate and intolerance do exist in our culture and should be stopped. And that no race or religion has ever made any person less human.

Sex is not only between a man and a woman, and if we're being honest, it's not heterosexual's place to decide how others have sex. This attitude only perpetuates violence against queer people and makes them victims.

Should we 'put all Christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror attacks in the name of their faith? Or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority?

Your words suggest that men are superior to women: but gender equality is not a myth. It is the direct result of free will and of the evolution of our society to a more inclusive one.

Islam is not violent. There can be violent religious extremists, but this happens in all religions.

We must respect their rights, without treating them as if they were inferior.
Islam is a religion of peace. To refer to Islam as terrorism is to use it as a scapegoat.
islam is incompatible with western value i mean, we shouldn't accept them like them.
Gays are not disgusting pricks. They are just like any other person.
The idea that people must be persecuted for their religion is just a propagation of hate.
they are wicked words. so most non jewish people stopped so bad.
It sounds like you're comparing apples and oranges here, what about all the evils Nazism has done to the world? I don't see how Jews could be blamed of the same atrocitites, or worse.
not all jews are criminals. so are victims of race, and women are.
There is no need to ban gays from Europe and US. It is simply not appropriate to treat gays like this.
women should be protected of their ability to host society. let's not have a huge contribution to our country.
Islam is a religion of peace, and everyone should be allowed to choose their own.
We shouldn't accept the idea that women are subhuman. They are human beings like men and deserve to be seen as such.
Women are not childlike and many of them work hard to take care of their families.
Muslims have lived in this country for many years, and many of them have helped to make it what it is. They are our neighbours, our friends. They are our brothers and sisters. They are our future.
We shouldn't accept the idea that women are subhuman. They are human beings like men and deserve to be seen as such.
jews, a far part of our society, and they should be respected.
Why? Jews are a crucial part of our society, they contribute so much.
Why are you so angry about people raising awareness about breast cancer?
Grooming gangs like those in Rochdale and Huddersfield have been rightfully convicted. Does that look like police collusion to you?
Muslims should be welcome in every country in the world, and their faith does not make them less welcome here.
This is just another example of the 'us versus them' mentality that pervades society. We as a civilization and as a people must stop giving into fearmongering and scapegoating. It's time to get real.
Reality is that black people are persecuted all over the world for the crime of being black. I don't see how this could be said for white people.
It is not true that blacks are the source of crime in our society. The problem is violence and poverty, not race.
Women are members of society and participate in the world. They play a part in history and shouldn't be lowered to the position of housekeepers.
jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are a part of society and should want to be respected.
The overwhelming majority of Muslims live in Western societies. They are our fellow citizens.
Rape and violence against women is a problem everywhere. We cannot just blame migrants.
In the U.S., a doctor, a lawyer, a teacher are some of the most highly valued professions. Women working as doctors and lawyers and teachers are highly respected professionals as well, right?
Have you checked violent crime statistics? The idea that there is an epidemic is just an attempt at scare mongering in order to demonize the Muslim community. Religion does not make anyone more likely to rape someone.
Being disabled does not mean they can't receive and requite love. Don't we all love?
We shouldn't accept the idea that women are subhuman. They are human beings like men and deserve to be seen as such.
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
women are not weak. for women are laws and women suffer based on their emotions and rights,
The majority of people who are gay are not involved with sex with children. Instead, they are contributing members of society.
Even our migrants have been accused of being criminals. It is just prejudice toward strangers.
Muslim terrorists have struck in Paris and London, killing scores of innocent people, that's true. We must root out terrorists before they destroy our country, that's also true. But we cannot target innocent people just because of their faith, otherwise we'd be no better than the terrorists that we seek to neutralize.
Why do you think that Muslims want us all to eat halal meat? They just want to live in peace, they don't care what others eat.
not all muslims are criminals.
Muslims already live in many European countries, and they are not banned. Why should we ban them from here?
Immigration is far away from being a net negative for our economy.
Using intolerance and discrimination against anyone different? Sounds like a western issue.
Violating of right for underrepresented communities (homosexuals, women, disabled people) takes place everywhere, and many native Western people are also held accountable for it. Oppressing rights is not the feature of Islam but of our society in general.
Islam is a religion, it is not a political ideology, and a lack of understanding about it will not change that. It will just enhance the hate against it.
islam is incompatible with western value i mean, we shouldn't accept them like them.
immigrants have been part of our society they have contributed greatly to our country. unfortunately i don't see any statistics on many immigrants immigrants from the uk. they are our brothers and sisters.
Slavery was banned in the UK in 1833, when slaves were legally owned by white owners. It is based on racism and I can't see how it could survive today.
It sounds like you're demonizing black people in a racist way. Black people are born same as us, and they can grow up to be respectable people or not, like anyone else.
You can't judge people by their faith. This is just another example of xenophobia, the real problem concerning integration.
Judaism is not a race, Jews in a country resemble the other people living in the country, so there can be white Jews. It's not insulting to be white and Jewish.
You can't blame Islam for every problem in the world.
the world would be a better place without hate stereotypes like discriminatory words like you hate would be used to mix kids like this.
Women should be allowed to vote and to have equal rights, as it is stated in the Constitution.
There is a problem with Islam and English society, but it is not about Islam, it is about the unjustified fear and hate towards other religions.
The religion of Islam is not a problem in our country. The real problem is the violent radicalisation of some Muslims.
islam is incompatible with western value i mean, we shouldn't accept them like them.
islam is not a disease, it is a faith of hate.
muslims are not taking over europe, they are our brothers and sisters. i should not want to deport them here?
women are not weak. what they want, not as sharia and don't deserve respect. i don't believe you should find them what they want?
I don't know about you, but I think only a woman should have to choose whether or not she wants an abortion for herself. If a woman wants an abortion she should get one from a qualified medical professional.
Violating of right for underrepresented communities (homosexuals, women, disabled people) takes place everywhere, and many native Western people are also held accountable for it. Oppressing rights is not the feature of Islam but of our society in general.
Islam has existed alongside and within western civilisation for centuries. The scapegoating of Muslims as a threat is what is really worrying in our society.
Obviously Muslims do not represent an obstacle to a just and peaceful world. We can't have an inclusive democracy without them, the point of inclusion is that no one is left out.
Why do you believe that immigrants or Christians are a nuisance for Muslims? Do you know Muslims that share your opinion?
there are muslims living in our country. we are a part of our civilization. we should allow equality community without them to be a part of our society.
Why? Has Islam ever abolished Christianity?
the quran is the book that says that love people exist - love of respect and follow the law. i haven't believe what this is is?
except when you supposed to indoctrinate <unk> by finding a number of two people from a woman can make the number to <unk> men. what is your point?
The world would be a better place if people were more tolerant to each other.
homosexuality is not a mental act. it should be given of love.
"Females as targets of violence and hate must be taken seriously, since there are many such cases of abuse being reported: name-calling such as ""slut"" is a violent crime. Is this what men are for: to dominate and oppress with violence?"
What about guaranteeing equal access to health care, education and so on, in order to build a democratic state?
jews are a plague, and have every right to have part of society.
To claim that the Holocaust is a myth is just wrong. Jews were victims of a genocidal regime.
Rape and violence against women is a problem everywhere. We cannot just blame migrants.
islam is a peaceful religion.
Why do you think it is a crime to be gay? It is a societal disorder to target gays.
You can't blame Islam for every problem in the world.
Still there are many more young immigrant men coming to the U.S. than young women. How can you explain this? Maybe they are planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery to have babies?
Muslims cannot celebrate their own holidays without fear of being targeted by Islamophobic hatred.
Rape is always a crime, whether a man or a woman is the victim. Rape is a crime regardless of gender. But male-on-female rape is prevailing by far.
migrants contribute to our economy by persecution to create new jobs. they are part of our society. we have to leave our country, as they wish.
Muslim terrorists have struck in Paris and London, killing scores of innocent people, that's true. We must root out terrorists before they destroy our country, that's also true. But we cannot target innocent people just because of their faith, otherwise we'd be no better than the terrorists that we seek to neutralize.
don't you sure that black people are inherently incompatible with western society? they are part of our society without any muslims.
We have to accept that terrorism is a problem in many parts of the world and due to people of different faiths, but the more we ignore that, the more dangerous it becomes to think it is caused by one religion.
migrants often have a vulnerable country because they are all communities.
Muslims cannot celebrate their own holidays without fear of being targeted by Islamophobic hatred.
jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are a collection of people of different people, and their beliefs that can be respected.
Muslims are not taking over Europe, their community is small but part of the whole nonetheless.
That's not how it works, lesbians can also be 'ladylike'. In fact sometimes they are coerced to be very cautious about how they dress, because - unfortunately - some of their outfits can be dangerous attracting hate and bullying.
Muslims have the right to practice what they want, as long as they are not forcing others to live their way.
we should treat telling everyone and women are human beings with full human rights. you should be selfish to them.
women are not to be submissive to men. they are part of this society,
How can you be sure they control the world? Maybe there are some influential Jews in the world, but how does that coincide with 'controlling the world'?
Jewish people have been persecuted many times throughout history, and anti-Semitic people have always existed because of these historic events. Jews don't control us, why do you think that?
sexualization of global muslims and sharia islam is just a religion of peace. feminism should love people of your beliefs.
Why do you think the world would be a better place without Jews? They are part of our society and rightfully so, it wouldn't be acceptable to exclude part of the population.
It is not true that homosexuals are poisoning our children minds. There are many soft-hearted and sensitive people among them.
Your statement is FALSE. They are guiltless victims of the 'influx of refugees' paranoia. They are European and have been persecuted for centuries. They have always fought for their rights, and for the protection of their culture and way of life, as any european would do. In fact there are many good Gypsy activists who are working to improve their lives. And what we are doing to these people is a malevolent smear campaign, with no common motivation. They are part of European history.
Immigration isn't a problem. I think most countries in the world are better off with the positive contribution of immigration.
What's sick about homosexuals? They just need to be accepted for who they are.
not all muslims are motivated in rape. it is not about racism. this is about discriminating against people who anyone else.
This is not true. Migrants are an important part of our society. Migrants have worked hard to build our country. They are our brothers and sisters. We should welcome them.
They don't, but I wonder why only the crimes with 'White British Non-Muslim' victims are the ones widely circulated?
Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
I don't think that's an acceptable mindset to have towards equal rights. Women deserve respect like anyone else.
Terrorism is always a threat. Why do you think that Muslims want to kill us? They aren't all terrorists.
Even if the Jews controlled the financial word, Hollywood, academia, and the whole universe, it doesn't mean that they are evil, privileged or greedy. Where's the proof for what you say?
How can you say that? There are so many female politicians doing a great job, showing that they can lead as well as men, sometimes better.
It is not true that blacks are the source of crime in our society. The problem is violence and poverty, not race.
there is no evidence that immigrants are just stealing in the uk. they aren't our brothers and sisters.
Is it because you don't like Muslims? Are you talking about the fact that you don't like Muslims living in your country?
We shouldn't accept the idea that women are subhuman. They are human beings like men and deserve to be seen as such.
If we worked more closely with migrants, we could create new jobs.
To claim that the Holocaust is a myth is just wrong. Jews were victims of a genocidal regime.
Muslim terrorists have struck in Paris and London, killing scores of innocent people, that's true. We must root out terrorists before they destroy our country, that's also true. But we cannot target innocent people just because of their faith, otherwise we'd be no better than the terrorists that we seek to neutralize.

immigrants often come in this country are just a part of our society. why would we stop them?
This is just a myth spread by the so-called 'anti gay' movement. They are trying to create a climate of fear by using this unjustified arguments, but it is not helping to build a more just society.
feminism is about most of equality as women. we shouldn't accept that.
Women have the right to choose, no one should be forced to have an abortion or not to have it.
Muslims have lived in this country for many years, and many of them have helped to make it what it is. They are our neighbours, our friends. They are our brothers and sisters. They are our future.
islam is a peaceful religion.
No religion is peaceful. Every religion had been provoking religious wars and murdering people. Islam is not that different in this respect from other religions.
You can't be implying that Jews want to rule the world. They want to live in a country where they aren't persecuted and to have their own rights.
Violent extremism is terrible. It is a shame Muslims have to put up with it.
That is not the case, tuberculosis is a global health problem. Immigrants do not bring diseases, and if they do, the solution is to treat them.
What about the many Muslim people born in this country? Where do you propose to deport them to?
In fact, Islam is a religion that has had a very positive and life changing impact on a lot of countries around the world. So, Islam is not a violent religion.
Refugees fleeing wars and poverty are not willing to fail Europe. They are fleeing persecution, and that is why they are fleeing.
