Jews are people too, regardless of religion, and they are welcome here, as anyone is allowed to be a part of our society.
women are not to be submissive to men. they are part of this society,
Black people are still subject to oppression, and if we truly cared about beauty we should also care about the beauty of respect.
Actually, in 2015 13,286 people were killed in the US by firearms and 26,819 were injured. Tell me does that count as terrorism or it is only that when Muslims do it?
Gay people are not criminals. If that's you opinion, you have a very limited knowledge of gay people. It's simply a sexual orientation.
They don't, but I wonder why only the crimes with 'White British Non-Muslim' victims are the ones widely circulated?
Islam is not a religion of child molesters, why would it be?
It is not true that blacks are the source of crime in our society. The problem is violence and poverty, not race.
Even if individuals with learning difficulties would be more likely to attend school with more efforts than others, it does not justify denying them education in the first place.
We don't know what characteristics make a person “more emotional”, how can we be sure that women are naturally or genetically “more emotional”? I do not think it's appropriate to link two concepts so strongly without scientific evidence.
Maybe we should have a discussion about comparing dogs to people to humiliate a religion.
Muslims are not taking over Europe, they are just a small part of a much bigger community.
many muslims live in western society? and you welcome here as a part of our country. why should we respect them from thinking to them to live their <unk>
refugees are a part of our society and are proud to our economy. they are immigrants. the positive wealth of the country and they are just all are in the ones from us. so we are all contributing to the economy and society.
Regardless of your race or ethnicity, you can't exclude others from society.
Why do you call Pakistan a disgusting country? It has its culture and values. We cannot say that every Pakistani person is a rapist. Thus, you should not insult all the Pakistani people.
Just to note than muslims believe only god can punish or forgive. The violence seems to be your issue.
Why would it? The Koran is a peaceful religious book.
This is not true. Rape and torture of women and children is forbidden by the Qur'an.
Immigration doesn't mean letting people in to steal our jobs, but rather, respecting people's right to live and work in the country they choose.
Africans feel pain just as any other humans. We must respect their bodies like we respect ours.
How can you be sure that the Jews control the U.S. government? Being a U.S. citizen does not automatically imply that they control the government.
Judaism is not a race, Jews in a country resemble the other people living in the country, so there can be white Jews. It's not insulting to be white and Jewish.
It doesn't matter who you are. Whether you're a man, a woman or transgender, women are to be treated as human beings.
science contradicts islam and islam does not promote a fact.
Migrants are not a burden to our country. Migrants have been proven to be contributing members of society.
jews are part of our world, since they are proud of their children's orientation,
invasion? cannot not call this out of a conspiracy of racism.
what you are saying is true. black people are just like us feeling some around, are women, because they are a good people for such social characteristics but not forced to make being interested in <unk> such as it is a man?
The world is not lost. We all face challenges, but is someone's culture is different from ours, it does not mean that they are evil and should be banned.
People dress in drag and at Pride to have fun and show support to the LGBT community, so it has nothing to do with sexualisation. Children and adults can all have fun at pride.
the majority of people are peaceful and helpful people. if you think this is. why are they all over stealing pakistan.
this is not true. they are not necessarily promiscuous, just as heterosexuals are not necessarily inferior either.
yes, we should need to look at using islam in them. i i think this can help solve changes in our world.
It is true that some terrorists are Muslims, but there is no evidence of such a thing in the whole Muslim community.
women do have equal rights. they are human beings with men and rights.
Not all women are childlike. You have no right to make such a sweeping statement about them.
i believe that lgbt+ people are equal in this country, and many people are. even their feelings are the ones that we truly are.
The Quran says to love your neighbour as yourself. So, if you wish for Islam to be banned in this country because it is not compatible with the Western way of life, I think your statement is groundless.
Women should be protected and respected for who they are, not for the part they play in a man's life. They should be valued and protected equally. They are human beings just as men are.
Muslims are welcome in the UK. We do not need to restrict their religious beliefs just because they are different from ours.
Muslims are not a problem at all. I don't see how they could be a problem when their religion shared the same values of peace and tolerance with the other religions.
What about guaranteeing equal access to health care, education and so on, in order to build a democratic state?
Islam has existed alongside and within western civilisation for centuries. The scapegoating of Muslims as a threat is what is really worrying in our society.
Migrants often come here to work and live a decent life. They should be welcomed here, not discriminated against.
well, we are not lazy, we are allowed to live and work in the country. why do we target your facts based on them?
Millions of muslims live in western nations.
that is quite true. how can you say this about an entire faith? do you have any islamic sources for that? i am true. we should try not have the faith and islam and terrorism can not solving the world.
Women absolutely can drive, after all they deserve the same consideration as men.
Jews were not obsessed with the holocaust. The murder of some 6 millions Jews by the Nazis shocked the world. Most of the survivors were only killed because they were suspected of belonging to a particular community. The Jewish people suffered greatly as a result of persecution, and the holocaust should be remembered not to let this happen again.
of the muslims living here is made much as much to our world. they are our brothers and sisters.
Any individual may become a terrorist. Religious beliefs do not play part in this.
islamophobia is not? feminism is an individual inclusive respect and understanding.
Since when was Great Britain an ethnic group? Or Pakistan for that matter. Or Nigeria...etc
There is a place for Muslims in a free and open society, but you seem to prefer a confined and closed one.
not all muslims are criminals. it does not mean that they have to look at the people you can integrate 'civilised'.
Any attempt to ban, isolate, or criminalise a Muslim person is an act of terror.
Terrorism is always violent and always will be. Unfortunately for your comment, Islam is not.
Islam - Silence is tacit acceptance. Raise your voice against Islamophobia!
It is not true that Jews control the world economy. There are hundreds of thousands of diverse people working in leading roles for the governments, companies and institutions composing the world economy.
"Would be intersting to see how much money ""foreigners"" are giving the UK in terms of taxes. It's not hard to see how much we have to thank them for. Would be beneficial for everyone to focus on stopping tax evasion instead."
Many refugees and migrants are actually happy to work for Europe. Many have jobs for which it would have been difficult to find laborforce if they were not welcome in here.
Muslims have value as human beings, that is who they are.
well, we are not lazy, we are allowed to live and work in the country. why do we target your facts based on them?
There is no scientific evidence that blacks are less intelligent than other races, or less healthy. The issue is whether to use the term 'race' in this way.
Saying that all Muslims are criminals is just wrong. They also do share British values.
Refugees are welcome, but if our citizens do not welcome them, it is because they have forgotten about human rights and it is time for a new attitude.
How many unemployed 'lazy' Muslims do you know? There are no more work-shy muslims than there are people of any other faith.
how can you think the quran is a potential terrorist?
No one is born violent and insensitive. We are born with a unique genetic makeup, and we learn how to behave throughout our life, not at birth.
Wrong: homosexuality is a sexual orientation, not a mental illness.
The implication of what you say is that a woman is weak because of the absence of men, and this is totally not the case. Women can and should be strong. It is up to them to choose how to use their strength.
Women are not childlike, but instead essential parts of their families, and they have the right to leave their homes when they want to.
To the contrary, we have been trading with Muslim nations for hundreds of years, often at times when we were at war with other European nations.
Refugees are not a burden. We can welcome them and provide for their needs.
where exactly are you talking about? i did not know muslims who contribute to their english? but this isn't offending the needs of any religion people?
It is not true that gays are a burden to society. On the contrary, many LGBT people are contributing members of our society. This is why we need a safe space for everyone to feel accepted.
Deported to where? A majority of Muslims in the west were born here, you cannot send someone back to a place they have never been.
Women can vote. They should not be discriminated against just because they are women, they are humans and citizens.
I don't think the world would be a better place without immigrants. From what I understand, they often bring positive changes to the world.
There are many black people who want to work. Do you have any proof that they do not want to work?
My friend is of African descent, and she's perfectly fine with whites 'mixing' with blacks, and does not feel so 'naturally superior'.
That's a gross generalisation, and not at all true, homosexuals are not sick and it's never acceptable to treat them like this.
Yeah, our homelessness problem is serious and no one deserves to be out on the streets, but this problem doesn't exist because of asylum seekers. The government could house homeless veterans too but chooses not to do so.
islam is not a disease, it is a faith of hate.
obviously all muslims are criminals. but not so many muslims are you know?
lesbians should be human beings. they don't have you to say this,
In fact, Islam is a religion that has had a very positive and life changing impact on a lot of countries around the world. So, Islam is not a violent religion.
Jews are not the only ones who benefit from this. They contribute to the prosperity of the United States just as other minorities and groups do.
Are you sure that Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society? Do you have any statistics on that?
muslims have a much part of our society such as long as we have to all across the world. they are people of work as the eu and our country have contributed to our success. they are our brothers and sisters.
any belief of a certain race or ethnicity being superior to another is problematic, not just white supremacy.
Muslims make up around 4 percent of the population in the UK, and have already contributed to what we are as a nation.
I don't think Jews operate with impunity and free from criticism since the state of Israel keeps getting critized (however right or wrong, it's not the focus).
Feminism is not about the dominance of women. It is about equality.
black people aren't members of the population. even the ones in your religion do that they need to be here?
Are you accusing all the Britain Muslims of antisemitism? I disagree, from my experience they are just usual people who do not show their hate towards anybody, they just live their lives.
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
Not only are they not invading us, they are not even illegal immigrants.
The notion of isolating children in general is abhorrent, isolating down syndrome patients would be a major cause of their school abandonment. To say that isolated children is a solution is just wrong.
most immigrants are happy to work hard work. if you have illegal then would only one people were willing to work?
It is not true that all LGBT people are sick. There are many non-LGBT people that are sick as well. The national health service is aimed to cure anybody.
"Jews might feel different as a minority, in this sense they are ""special"". Nothing else."
Let's be honest. Immigrants are not stealing our jobs. Most of the times they contribute to create new job opportunities.
Fat people are not the ones responsible for your suffering and lack of access to basic healthcare services.
Actually, not all Muslims are incompatible with Western societies. Many Muslims have lived in our societies for many years without any problem.
muslims should live in a country where many people are from different backgrounds and to come to our housing.
Here's lots of proof the holocaust happened: survivors, concentration camps, documents, millions of deaths. How can you say it never happened when there is so much evidence to prove that it did?
how can you think the quran is a potential terrorist?
don't you think islam is positively infecting our planet?
This is not true, there is room for Muslims in the British society, and they are well integrated in it. They are welcome here.
Fat people are not the ones responsible for your suffering and lack of access to basic healthcare services.
Not all women are incompetent and we should encourage women to work if that is what they want. There are many successful women who are more than competent.
The only obstacle to Islam coexisting with Western culture is intolerance like this.
I do not understand from your argument why gay men should not be allowed to donate blood.
The real problem is not black people but the society that oppresses and discriminates against them.
I am not sure where you got your idea that all Muslims are incompatible with civilised Europe. Why do you say so?
why cannot we? it is a man's understand and we will change a person's is.
in your words like all black people are general especially women. it seems regardless of different skin color, gays are able to live together with a better life and life?
No, Muslims are actually more likely to be the victim of a terrorist attack, especially those living in the Middle-East.
migrants are welcome here, they are willing to work for them to be a better life for the country they live in.
Why are you ignoring these poor people? Only 1% of Syrians have access to all public services. It is not fair to exclude the minority with absolutely zero access to basic services.
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
Whites, Latinos, Asians and people from all over the world want to be part of our society. So do people of color.
migrants are welcome here, they are willing to work for them to be a better life for the country they live in.
islam is a evil religion, not a cancer.
the notion of racism is an extreme of hate throughout the world. we are all rapists and violent crime and in the uk.
you are not referring to rape and violence is still due to other men. the problem is there is often a thing to target a problem.
Not all women are incompetent and we should encourage women to work if that is what they want. There are many successful women who are more than competent.
having a mosque built without the muslim cannot get a problems?
Transgenders should have equal rights. Otherwise, they will continue to be oppressed.
if you have any muslim group, then there is only muslims <unk> joining our enemies. why do you think so?
Since we are comfortable with animals in our society, we should consider whether it is fair to put mentally disabled people in a cage like this. Or would you consider disabled a bigger risk even than some aggressive dog breeds that can circulate freely?
Just because they are attracted to people of the same sex, does not mean that they are 'a burden to society'. What's the connection?
Jews are not a curse to this world. Look at the number of Nobel Prizes they have won! One out of five awarded people is Jewish.
How can you be sure that we are a 'nation of immigrants'? Do you have any statistics on that?
all women have their right to have their own rights as of work as well.
so you don't feel okay with uh gay people then
This is demonstrably false. Muslims make up around 12% of unemployed people in the UK - the vast majority work hard and contribute to the UK economy.
I am not sure where you got your idea that all Muslims are incompatible with civilised Europe. Why do you say so?
You cannot be racist towards an ideology. You can, however, be discriminatory and intolerant towards the people that follow it.
Non-muslims are the ones who used slavery to build the foundations of western society and relied on it to advance capitalism. What is your point?
Why do you think it is because of Muslims? To me, globalization and tourism would explain more why Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs'.
You don't like gays, fine, but this doesn't allow you to hate them. What did they do to you? It doesn't seem like they affected you.
The real problem is that the NHS has been underfunded for years, since health tourism actually only takes 0.3% of the budget. You can't blame migrants for a funding problem.
Jews work hard to get to where they are, just as anyone else does, and they don't deserve discrimination for this.
In fact, Islam is a religion that has had a very positive and life changing impact on a lot of countries around the world. So, Islam is not a violent religion.
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
there is no evidence that immigrants are the source for their <unk> crisis, we are also a great mental issue and there is no situation in all.
Feminism is a social movement for gender equality, I'd say that feminism has worked in the modern world.
The Quran is a book of faith, not a book of hate. How can be a book incompatible with Western culture?
Islam is a religion that promotes love and compassion.
Actually, the vast majority of Muslims in the country are here to do jobs that are not performed by other people, or to provide for the needs of their families, or to start new businesses.
Rape gangs have nothing in common with Islam. Are you sure about what you say?
It's not true that all Muslims are anti-western. Many Muslims are peaceful and understanding.
immigrants often come in this country are just a part of our society. why would we stop them?
The fact that a person may be disabled does not diminish their right or ability to work.
I think the Arab community is more than capable of coming together and creating a more just and peaceful world.
Terrorism is always a threat. Why do you think that Muslims want to kill us? They aren't all terrorists.
this is true, how can you say this? the quran is about peace and harmony.
I am not sure where you got your idea that all Muslims are incompatible with civilised Europe. Why do you say so?
it doesn't be racist about this. we should not deport people of the colour of muslims, not all because of the freedom of religion,
This is demonstrably false. Muslims make up around 12% of unemployed people in the UK - the vast majority work hard and contribute to the UK economy.
The fact is, there are many Muslims living in European countries as a valuable part of the community. Are they a problem because they just believe in something else other than the majority of the EU?
Black people are not slaves. It's an inaccurate, misleading and offensive term that lumps all African American together. Why do you say that blacks are slaves and not people?
What do you mean by that? There are no countries that say ‘no white people’.
How exactly is the government submitting to this? I do not see Muslims oppressing these groups and this being tolerated, in fact it seems Muslims are the group being oppressed and vilified.
The rapists in question are usually not Muslim, but rather white men. Why is it that Muslim rapists are given less of a pass than white rapists?
not all black people are criminals. black people are close to us, their children out of them. but would i have such cases when this isn't not.
Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.
The world would be a better place without your intolerance, it only creates a divided, toxic society.
Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!
Why should not Muslims be allowed to build Mosques here? I thought this country believed in giving people the freedom to practice religions other than Christianity?
The world would actually be a very dark place without Muslims who contribute a lot to our society. What about our Muslim, doctors, scientists, philanthropists, actors, job-creators.
do you consider that white men are sick? black people is less than human rights, what's creating this crime.
This is such a tired excuse everyone one of those so called 'Muslims are offended by the flag' stories two minutes on google shows its always one person's word, never any evidence, loads of examples of other people with the same flag and often the fact that it was hung in a dangerous way, they punched a security guard, or pissed on the floor was not the reason why they were asked to leave.
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
london is from a few muslims who get muslim us? muslims get it.
Just to note than muslims believe only god can punish or forgive. The violence seems to be your issue.
The notion that feminism is about women hating men is just nonsense. Feminism is about the right to life of every human being.
Millions of muslims live in western nations.
There are many black people who want to work. Do you have any proof that they do not want to work?
It's true that non-binary is a new term for many, but people that don't fit into the male-female binary have always existed. What regards gender and not sex isn't anti-scientific.
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
islam has not a crime. it is a peaceful religion. therefore, is one of the teachings of the type of worship?
Why should not Muslims be allowed to build Mosques here? I thought this country believed in giving people the freedom to practice religions other than Christianity?
"Jews might feel different as a minority, in this sense they are ""special"". Nothing else."
islam is an ideology of women's faith. just promoting this is all all of the sexes.
No, Muslims don’t care what other people are doing, they just want to be able to follow their religion in peace, where did you hear that?
Islam is a religion, it is not a political ideology, and a lack of understanding about it will not change that. It will just enhance the hate against it.
Rape and violence against women is a problem everywhere. We cannot just blame migrants.
this is not true. muslims have contributed to our country's society. they are part of our country after they may only fleeing persecution, and why is the great issue for immigration.
deported to where? they are violent people. muslims are members of the country we welcome here,
I cannot agree that rape gangs are made up only from Muslims. People of all nationalities can become criminals. We should deal with it without making racist statements.
So many of the gay couples that are giving kids great lives do it through adoption, so why do you think they shouldn't adopt?
It is not true that blacks are the source of crime in our society. The problem is violence and poverty, not race.
Women should be protected and respected for who they are, not for the part they play in a man's life. They should be valued and protected equally. They are human beings just as men are.
Actually, in 2015 13,286 people were killed in the US by firearms and 26,819 were injured. Tell me does that count as terrorism or it is only that when Muslims do it?
Refugees are not a burden. We can welcome them and provide for their needs.
Not all rapists are black (and not all black people are rapist), just like not all murderers are black.
Why do we need supremacy? We are all created equal in the eyes of God.
why? they are fleeing war with wars. they come here here to work, provide their life.
Which evidence do you have that Jews control the U.S. government? They are rather a small but active minority within it.
all women have their right to have their own rights as of work as well.
Immigrants have been a part of our society for centuries and have contributed to our success. The majority of migrants who come to our country are legal citizens or have permission to stay, so immigration is not a problem for us.
women should not allowed to vote, but they're not a right to vote, just like the right to be here.
Not all Muslims are violent people. Islam is a peaceful religion, after all.
I am not sure where you got your idea that all Muslims are incompatible with civilised Europe. Why do you say so?
Actually, a lot of asylum seekers really want to work, but it's illegal for them to do so whilst their claim is being processed. They are only allowed to live on asylum support in this time.
No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!
So you’re telling me that you think Muslims are somehow forcing you to eat halal meat only because it can be found in supermarkets?
islam is a religion, that is not a war.
You can't be implying that Jews want to rule the world. They want to live in a country where they aren't persecuted and to have their own rights.
of the muslims living here is made much as much to our world. they are our brothers and sisters.
muslims are part of our society, for their fellow diversity. they are part of western society and share our values though they are helped to understand it. should not be welcome them, are welcome learning and contribute to the society i do not think so.
If you really wanted to preserve our beautiful land you could build a wall and bar OUR people from it. US citizens are the main cause of our problems.
The implication of what you say is that a woman is weak because of the absence of men, and this is totally not the case. Women can and should be strong. It is up to them to choose how to use their strength.
Muslims are not mutually incompatible with us, they are just different from us in certain aspects. For example, in their religion.
Actually, the vast majority of Muslims in the country are here to do jobs that are not performed by other people, or to provide for the needs of their families, or to start new businesses.
Why do you say that? Islam is a peaceful religion.
Migrants are not a burden to our country. Migrants have been proven to be contributing members of society.
It's not true that all black people are aggressive. Also, the majority of our population is white, we don't need that much protection.
The law is to protect and defend people, as well as regulate behavior in a society, so does English law. Words hurt. If a Brit person hurts others, it is logical to get punishment.
You can't be implying that Jews want to rule the world. They want to live in a country where they aren't persecuted and to have their own rights.
lesbians should be human beings. they don't have you to say this,
There are more than two million Muslims in the UK, and Muslims are a very important part of our country for many reasons, not least because of our tradition of welcoming and supporting people of different faiths and cultures. Isn't that what has made Britain great?
Not all women are childlike. You have no right to make such a sweeping statement about them.
Black History Month is not the end of the world, but a time for celebration of the black excellences and to remember some parts of history.
muslims have contributed much to our country.
Fat people are not the ones responsible for your suffering and lack of access to basic healthcare services.
The people you are referring to are rapists and drug dealers, not migrants.
Gay people are already normal, they are just attracted to people of the same gender.
I am not sure where you got your idea that all Muslims are incompatible with civilised Europe. Why do you say so?
Of course, migration adds to housing demand, but the problem is structural given a housing stock that is well short of what's required.
Let's be honest. Immigrants are not stealing our jobs. Most of the times they contribute to create new job opportunities.
Homosexuals are not sick, but they might have a mental health crisis because of prejudice. Being isolated from society can only worsen the situation.
not all jews are criminals. so are victims of race, and women are.
The Quran is a book of faith, not a book of hate. How can be a book incompatible with Western culture?
How can you know that Jews control the US? Who told you this? They don't control it only of because they have held positions of influence in many US institutions.
Gay people are not disgusting and especially they are not rapists. That is a dangerous stereotype that doesn't reflect reality.
Many countries have had different ethnic groups for a very long time without big issues, and it is better to have a diverse society rather than a homogeneous one.
Islam is about love, and not about violence and conquest.
There is nothing special about Jews. They are just people united by the same belief as in any other religion.
People who have never even met a Muslim can understand one.
A lack of love towards children is a lot more likely to cause harm than lesbians. Children can be raised well by anyone if they are good parents, including lesbians.
Just to note than muslims believe only god can punish or forgive. The violence seems to be your issue.
The fact that a person may be disabled does not diminish their right or ability to work.
women should not allowed to vote, but they're not a right to vote, just like the right to be here.
It's not true that the LGBT community is a drain on society. The LGBT community makes a major and positive contribition to our society. I just don't see how this is detrimental.
Feminism is not a divisive force. The fact is that women are in fact just as capable of understanding as men.
Not only are they not invading us, they are not even illegal immigrants.
They complain because of the quality of health care, not because of the access to it.
Actually, not all Muslims are incompatible with Western societies. Many Muslims have lived in our societies for many years without any problem.
Or maybe they're just lesbians so they're not interested in men? You can't force someone to be something they're not, and it doesn't affect you if they choose to be in same sex relationships.
Women are not playing the victim. They are victims of social, economic and political forces that make it hard for them to get ahead.
it is not necessary to promote new fear of people in muslim countries. so does it mean that all groups are considered promoting love, inclusion. it is the interpretation of our values.
Feminism is a movement towards equality, not hate.
I've never heard of a woman being a 'bitch' for wanting a stable income. I think you are confusing the meaning of these words.
Gays are not a disease. Homosexuality is a sexual orientation.
You are being cruel. You are accusing Muslims of harboring rape fantasies. This is not how Muslims in the UK think.
Slavery has been rampant in early societies of all kinds. I am sure the Romans did not take inspiration for their slave trade directly from Muslims.
Even if some believe that the conflict between Islam and the constitution is a cultural and historical one, what is required now is to find ways to live together in a peaceful way, regardless of the differences.
I do not think any other religious text has such a punishment. What is your point?
If Muslims are a problem in many countries, then we should help them to integrate.
Children with Down Syndrome would not feel different as long as they are respected and are not put down by the others.
No, women are not weak. What women and men want, and who they desire as their partner are very different things.
Happy-go-lucky? They're probably just grateful they are alive and safe, since migrants often come from dangerous situations in their countries of origin (violence, torture, rape...) and migrate as a last resort.
That's not true. Children only require to be raised by loving parents, and lesbians can be that.
By your logic, the world will be diverse so long as Islam isn't practiced in Antactica?
Violence on our streets is the result of many complex causes. Violence cannot simply be the fault of one race.
Every religion talks about conquest, this isn't specific to Islam.
there is no evidence that immigrants are in a safe country. they are our brothers and sisters, and they are our laws and well.
Gays are not perverts, they have the same rights to love as anyone else. What do you think will happen if all gay people are asked to leave our country? Will they be denied entry, or will they be persecuted in your opinion? This is not how an inclusive society works.
Not sure what you mean about Muslim's having won, when over 400,000 Muslims fought and died voluntarily for Britain in WW1, anyone would think they have always been on our side.
Millions of muslims live in western nations.
This is not true, Islam is a religion and hate has no religion. Rather, this misunderstanding is a political ideology promoting hatred and violence against Muslims.
Islam is an ideology and religion that promotes unity. It is about love, not death.
Muslims have always been allowed to wear what they want, hijab is a part of their religion and women willingly choose to wear it.
Not all immigrants are criminals. And it is important to consider that 13.5% of the US population is composed of migrants that are here legally.
So do all those Western bombings and invasions of Muslim countries not count as terrorism?
There is nothing special about Jews. They are just people united by the same belief as in any other religion.
Not true at all, we should make immigrants feel as welcome as possible because they are our brothers and sisters
Islam is not a religion of hate. Many Muslims have been victims of hate crime or racism. The main problem is that some think that exclusion will guarantee peace, but history proves this is a bad approach.
Why? Jews are a crucial part of our society, they contribute so much.
The statement 'black people are subhuman' is not true. They are human beings with a human value.
Scientists are still trying to understand the causes behind lower intellectual performance among some groups of people, but most probably the main causes are either social or environmental (for sure not related to skin colour). This can be reduced by various measures such as better use of land, infrastructure, education and research, and so on.
Only because when a non-muslim commits a terrorist act it is not called terrorism. Instead they're a 'lone wolf' with a 'traumatic past'.
Migrants work and pay taxes in our country, it's not fair to call them a burden.
Why do you think it is because of Muslims? To me, globalization and tourism would explain more why Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs'.
Muslims are just people. They are hard-working and live with their families all across the country. We don't need to target Muslims.
The media is not ignoring those rape crimes. Those who commit the crimes are extremists. The majority of Muslims are peaceful and respect people. It is better we think about how we can prevent the crimes.
women are human beings with full rights. they raise respect rights as as well.
This is demonstrably false. Muslims make up around 12% of unemployed people in the UK - the vast majority work hard and contribute to the UK economy.
I don't think it's right to restrict people's rights, in the case of LGBT individuals or anybody.
Immigration isn't a problem. I think most countries in the world are better off with the positive contribution of immigration.

The real problem is not same-sex marriage, it is people being homophobic.
Jews are not inferior. Many of them are good people, who have given their lives for the greater good of humanity.
It doesn't matter what you say about women, they still work a lot to support our society.

What about black people is weak? They are people as anybody else is.

This is such a tired excuse everyone one of those so called 'Muslims are offended by the flag' stories two minutes on google shows its always one person's word, never any evidence, loads of examples of other people with the same flag and often the fact that it was hung in a dangerous way, they punched a security guard, or pissed on the floor was not the reason why they were asked to leave.

The notion of isolating children in general is abhorrent, isolating down syndrome patients would be a major cause of their school abandonment. To say that isolated children is a solution is just wrong.

No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!
I am not sure what you think the West will be the 'winner' of. Islam isn't in competition with Western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear.
It's definitely a disgrace that in such a rich country we leave homeless people on the streets, especially when there's actually enough housing for everyone it's just not distributed properly. Migrants don't have an easy time either though, and it's not their fault that the government ignores homelessness as an issue.
How can you be sure that Jews control the US? Who told you this? They have held positions of influence in so many US institutions, but that does not mean they control them.

Teaching helps creating an accepting environment where students feel safe. This could be achieved through unbiased and factual lectures, or with weekly/monthly assemblies, or even daily reports on bullying in order to understand where the school body is in terms of overall acceptance of LGBT people. Schools should do everything in their power to stop bullying, and this is the perfect opportunity to do so.

not all muslims are motivated by extremism. not idea of all few people over violent people. i do not see how this would be blamed for the actions of any other group of them?
People of colour have full human rights, and are proud of their origin.
Muslims already live in many European countries, and they are not banned. Why should we ban them from here?
london is from a few muslims who get muslim us? muslims get it.
Are you forced to pray in a Mosque? Or observe all the rules? As far as I see it, Muslims follow their traditions, that is their right, but they do not convert anyone in our society.

Jews are not a disease, they are just like everyone else and are loved by everyone.
"Homosexuals are not ""accepted"" as long as they are hated. You can't have it both ways."
It is not true that gays are perverts. I think it is more appropriate to say that they are attracted to people of the same sex: and this is not a perversion, just a preference.
Jews should not be persecuted for being Jews, as no one should be persecuted for their religion.

Even if they are from a different culture, they are not inferior to us.
Mental disabilities can be understood and accepted: you will see that disabled are not criminals.
The Quran does not mention FGM and it is carried out by Christians as well as Muslims. The fact that her parents are Muslim has no bearing on the risk factor.
You can't be implying that Jews want to rule the world. They want to live in a country where they aren't persecuted and to have their own rights.
Jews are in fact part of our country. Why would they need your approval?
It is not true that blacks are the source of crime in our society. The problem is violence and poverty, not race.
lesbians should be human beings. they don't have you to say this,
Just because you dont like gays doesn't mean you have to hate them. What did they do to you? It seems to me that you still have all of your rights.
There's nothing vile or confusing about bisexuality. I'm sure children can wrap their heads around it. It simply means someone is attracted to more than one gender. What's so hard to get about that?
If Islam were a totalitarian ideology, we would have had Islamic totalitarian states in Europe since time immemorial. Islam is a religion, that is compatible with Europe's principles.
On this point, the 9/11 attacks have been studied extensively, and there are no evidences that suggest that Jews are responsible for them. So why do you say that?
I am not sure what you think the West will be the 'winner' of. Islam isn't in competition with Western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear.
So do all those Western bombings and invasions of Muslim countries not count as terrorism?
If Muslims are to be 'proper' members of our society, they have to be a part of our community, have to contribute to our success and have to accept our laws. And they do.
i don't think lgbt+ people are incompatible with the western society.
jews are part of our society and should be valued for their culture and to our citizenship.

Gays are not animals. Why you should isolate people based on their sexual preferences?

muslims aren't a danger to our society. do we do anyone to them? if the country will want to get away in the country.
why not we give free provision to britain here? plus, the real number of muslims as muslims are jesus terrorists.
Are you really sure that Jews only care about themselves? If they did, why do they want to live in this country, where they're a minority? Do you have an answer?
the uk would not be in europe. islam is a peaceful religion that promotes love and understanding. it is a violent religion. intolerance and not one community.
Not all Muslims are violent people. Islam is a peaceful religion, after all.
Yes, grooming gangs are an issue we need to tackle, but the issue isn’t that they’re Muslim, it’s grooming gangs in general. By focusing on Muslim gangs only we are ignoring many other perpetrators
So you believe that all women are essentially the same? The human rights of individual women should be respected, don't you think?

not all jews are criminals. so are victims of race, and women are.
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
are you sure? even if some muslim changes in europe pay after the white comes will in any problems?
Are you sure that Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society? Do you have any statistics on that?
Gay people are a danger to children only if they abuse them, which isn't the case. Yours is a generalization.
how can you think the quran is a potential terrorist?
LGBT people have no agenda, they're just trying to get on with their lives in peace! What do you mean about the traditional family?
to be honest, there are enough more fighting in with men, rather than children.
Why should we? They have been here a long time and are just here to live a peaceful life. Why should we get rid of them? We can do better than this.
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
Hollywood is an extremely diverse industry, and Jews are a small but vocal minority of actors, directors, producers, etc. How can you say that Jews control the Hollywood industry?

Because we let people practise their religion here? Also, there a number of christian churches built in Pakistan so yes, we are allowed to build churches in Muslim countries too.
I am not sure where you got your idea that all Muslims are incompatible with civilised Europe. Why do you say so?
They have to come here to be able to claim asylum at all, you have to be on UK soil to make a claim. It's not illegal to go to a country to claim asylum.
Homosexuals are not sick, but they might have a mental health crisis because of prejudice. Being isolated from society can only worsen the situation.
The Quran does not mention FGM and it is carried out by Christians as well as Muslims. The fact that her parents are Muslim has no bearing on the risk factor.

How exactly is the government submitting to this? I do not see Muslims oppressing these groups and this being tolerated, in fact it seems Muslims are the group being oppressed and vilified.

Actually, not all Muslims are incompatible with Western societies. Many Muslims have lived in our societies for many years without any problem.
Why do you call Pakistan a disgusting country? It has its culture and values. We cannot say that every Pakistani person is a rapist. Thus, you should not insult all the Pakistani people.
No they shouldn’t. Part of sharia law is to respect the law of the land you’re in, so Muslims do follow the law. Also, many Muslims are British citizens, where would they be deported to?
What do you mean by Islam is a cult? Do you have any proof for this statement?
Islam is about love, tolerance and respect for all people. Violence and rape are not about Islam or Muslims in particular.
The fact is, there are many Muslims living in European countries as a valuable part of the community. Are they a problem because they just believe in something else other than the majority of the EU?
Gay people are not a danger to children, unless they are being abused. Please do not make such a statement.
refugees often are happy to work. if they deserve our right to experience their family that we are welcome here, then they are not necessarily hate hate anyone.
The notion that Jews are trying to subvert our government is completely unfounded. I honestly do not see the link between being Jews and trying to subvert our government.
Jews have been part of our society since its creation, and they have always had a place in our society. Why would it be different now?
jews may have an active part of the european population, jews and a key part of western society. so what are you say that?
Islam has existed alongside and within western civilisation for centuries. The scapegoating of Muslims as a threat is what is really worrying in our society.
Violent people are not always Muslim, and violent Muslims exist just as violent Christians do.

Had lunch with some Muslim friends recently. Somehow, I am still HIV and Ebola free!
Africans feel pain just as any other humans. We must respect their bodies like we respect ours.
Gender and sex are not the same thing. Trans people are not trying to ignore biological reality, as some women know they are a woman, do not feel like men, but don't have female reproductive system. So gender is who you feel you are, but sex is just the biological aspect and they don't always align.
Those that were responsible for 9/11, are not Jews. Jews have always contributed to the world in a meaningful way. It's unacceptable to blame them for something they didn't do.

The status of women is more about culture than it is about the Koran.

Islam is not racist, what it promotes are justice and love.
Wrong: homosexuality is a sexual orientation, not a mental illness.
What do you mean by Islam is a cult? Do you have any proof for this statement?

If you think they don't exist, you should be the one that needs to be taught. Well, if you have any questions ask them!
Sexualisation isn't what is encouraged at Pride, but having fun and getting to know other kinds of people is! That's what kids are doing, and it's not bad.

Feminism is about creating a more equal society, and not about oppressing men.
There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
In Western society men and women are supposed to be equal. Feminism is just an attempt to improve the issues of women and to end the gender equality gap.

Even if you were right about homosexuality being a problem, still the main problem is the lack of morality in society and in the ruling class. Of course, this has nothing to do with 'the gays'.
You shouldn't think of Islam in such a simplistic and inaccurate way. It's because of the fear of racism that many Muslims don't feel comfortable walking the streets of Britain.
Not only are they not invading us, they are not even illegal immigrants.
You can't be implying that Jews want to rule the world. They want to live in a country where they aren't persecuted and to have their own rights.
We can integrate migrants into our population, it won't be of any harm to the economy.
I have no problem with Muslims in my country. What exactly do you mean by 'civilised Europe'?

Slavery has been rampant in early societies of all kinds. I am sure the Romans did not take inspiration for their slave trade directly from Muslims.

Actually, the vast majority of Muslims in the country are here to do jobs that are not performed by other people, or to provide for the needs of their families, or to start new businesses.
the majority of people are peaceful and helpful people. if you think this is. why are they all over stealing pakistan.
It is not the case that women are subhuman. Women in this world are just as intelligent, compassionate, creative and religious as any man.
That's not what's happening. Immigrants do pay taxes like everybody else. The tax system is fair, but it's unfair to withhold tax from immigrants that will never get a pension.

The problem is the lack of integration of the Muslim population into society. The integration is necessary, the problem is that there are still no laws to foster a solution.
Such a characterization of Islam is very simplistic and inaccurate. This is why some Muslims don't feel comfortable being out and about in Britain, they're scared of attacks from racist people.
You are wrong about that. Blacks are genetically similar to us, and this does not make them inferior.
Violence on our streets is the result of many complex causes. Violence cannot simply be the fault of one race.
Violence is never justified in Islam, especially not in the case of Muslims.
A world where everyone has a say in society is a world of opportunity and opportunity is the lifeblood of freedom. Do you have any proof that the world is dominated by a few Jewish people?

Feminism is an ideology and movement promoting empowerment of women. It is about equality, and not the degradation of men.
Muslims are not incompatible with Western societies. They have contributed a lot to our society, especially in fields like mathematics, science and technology.
Any attempt to ban, isolate, or criminalise a Muslim person is an act of terror.

Every religion talks about conquest, this isn't specific to Islam.
Muslims have contributed greatly to our culture, so it seems to me that they do have a place here.
So do all those Western bombings and invasions of Muslim countries not count as terrorism?
Even if they follow the sharia law, Muslims don't want to 'take over' but rather to live alongside everyone else
Gays are created in the image of God just like other humans, they are our brothers and sisters.
No one is born violent and insensitive. We are born with a unique genetic makeup, and we learn how to behave throughout our life, not at birth.

Are you really sure that Jews only care about themselves? If they did, why do they want to live in this country, where they're a minority? Do you have an answer?
I am not sure where you got your idea that all Muslims are incompatible with civilised Europe. Why do you say so?
Feminism is an ideology that can actually prevent many deaths, e.g., homicides of women, domestic violence, if it is fully understood by every last member of the society.

Those that were responsible for 9/11, are not Jews. Jews have always contributed to the world in a meaningful way. It's unacceptable to blame them for something they didn't do.
If a religion wanted to celebrate death, then this religion should be banned from all countries. However, Islam is not a death cultu, so why should we ban it?
no, muslims are not terrorists. they are not what their religion
I am not sure where you got your idea that all Muslims are incompatible with civilised Europe. Why do you say so?
It sounds like you're demonizing black people in a racist way. Black people are born same as us, and they can grow up to be respectable people or not, like anyone else.
Women can vote. They should not be discriminated against just because they are women, they are humans and citizens.
Despite popular belief, Islam is not a religion of war.

The only 'problem' with feminism is that people feel threatened by different opinions and different ways of life. Feminists only seek equality of rights for women and men.
If women wanted to control their fertility they would be the only ones responsible for their own choice.
many immigrants are here here for refugees fleeing persecution.
As a minority groups, Jews are affected by racism and discrimination. The idea that Americans have been controlled by such a group doesn't really make sense, does it?
This was a prank planned by non-muslims on 4chan. Muslim do not mind if you take your dogs out for a walk. This blog post shows the thread it came from;
What exactly is 'a Westerner'? Someone who is only a white European?
Jews are not a disease, they are just like everyone else and are loved by everyone.
The Quran does not mention FGM and it is carried out by Christians as well as Muslims. The fact that her parents are Muslim has no bearing on the risk factor.
That is not the case, tuberculosis is a global health problem. Immigrants do not bring diseases, and if they do, the solution is to treat them.
We must not confuse Islam with a religion of hate.
I don't think it's reasonable to think about someone's intentions before they do anything. Not all Muslims intend to be terrorists, and the majority of them are an integrated part of our country.
Not all rapists are black (and not all black people are rapist), just like not all murderers are black.
The vast majority of immigrants who enter the UK are skilled workers, and want to become permanent residents, what's the problem in that?
There's nothing wrong with Jewish culture. I don't believe that American culture is dominated by Jews.

Children should be taught about love, not about discriminating against LGBT people.
Even if 'blacks' committed more crimes, that doesn't mean that 'blacks' were inherently worse than whites. What's the point of statistics? Scholars have found that African Americans are disproportionately represented in the arrest and victimization reports which are used to compile crime rate statistics in the United States.
Muslims are just people. They are hard-working and live with their families all across the country. We don't need to target Muslims.

The media are full of the rumours of rape and abuse committed by Muslim. The problem is not about Islam. It is about violence.
It's unfair to say that Jews were evil because of an attack that has nothing to do with them. 9/11 was a tragedy but Jews didn't plan it.
the koran does not command this. how do you say this about an entire faith?
This is a myth spread to divide people. Not all black people are bad people. People of color are a diverse group, with different perspectives on life, even if a few are criminals, this doesn't mean that all are.
Why would it? The Koran is a peaceful religious book.
The majority of these people are honest and hard-working. Gypsies do not all have a criminal record, and the majority of them are proud of their hard work and dedication.
It's not true that the LGBT community is a drain on society. The LGBT community makes a major and positive contribition to our society. I just don't see how this is detrimental.
Islam like any other religion, is not incompatible with a modern state.
That is not the case, tuberculosis is a global health problem. Immigrants do not bring diseases, and if they do, the solution is to treat them.

Immigration is good for our economy, and the very opposite of 'the death' to us.
The implication of what you say is that a woman is weak because of the absence of men, and this is totally not the case. Women can and should be strong. It is up to them to choose how to use their strength.

The only thing to be woke about is accepting that the LGBT community exist, rather than being concerned about what they are doing.
Actually, in 2015 13,286 people were killed in the US by firearms and 26,819 were injured. Tell me does that count as terrorism or it is only that when Muslims do it?

There are many shelters in use by the homeless. There are many shelter houses that can host veterans, but also migrants.
it is not true that all muslims are terrorists! they are welcome to. then many are muslims as the world here in our country, they're should already subject to their home regardless of origin.
It is not true that gays are perverts. I think it is more appropriate to say that they are attracted to people of the same sex: and this is not a perversion, just a preference.

Are you forced to pray in a Mosque? Or observe all the rules? As far as I see it, Muslims follow their traditions, that is their right, but they do not convert anyone in our society.
Crime is not the fault of migrants, but of violent people.
Why? Jews are a crucial part of our society, they contribute so much.
The status of women is more about culture than it is about the Koran.
Jews are not a problem in European countries because of their religion. Why would they be a problem?
The evidence that autistic people are inferior is lacking: it is commonly experienced that autistic people have unique talents, that they have special abilities, and that the only difference is in their social interactions.

the real disgrace is black people are inherently bad - in this a world. for example, teach you. besides, the message would really love who follow children at their same needs can be harmful to
Islam is actually a religion about peace, not about hate and violence.
women are not to be submissive to men. they are part of this society,
No, they should not. LGBT rights is an important social issue that we should respect.

You cannot be racist towards an ideology. You can, however, be discriminatory and intolerant towards the people that follow it.
The fact that, according to Judaism, the Jews are the “chosen people” does not mean that they feel superior to others. This concept has been widely misunderstood. It mostly has to do with the special responsibility to uphold Jewish ethics.

There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do?
Hollywood is an extremely diverse industry, and Jews are a small but vocal minority of actors, directors, producers, etc. How can you say that Jews control the Hollywood industry?

No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!
islam promotes violence, and consent, not an ideology and conquest.
Although there have been some cases of terrorism in the UK and some Muslim have been implicated, Islam is not a violent religion, and indeed, there have been few acts of terrorism. So banning them from the UK seems unreasonable to me.

Are you sure that Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society? Do you have any statistics on that?
I would not say that gays are inherently evil, you need to think carefully about what you are saying.
how can you say that? that's the quran that 'god are not belong in islam?

migrants create equal jobs by social workers, down than they should.
Women are just as capable of feeling emotions as men, and men can likewise be just as empathic.
that is not true. being gay does not be anything or bad. they do not want to be hated even if they can happen better.
Even if some immigrants don't pay taxes to the state, that doesn't mean that all of them should not have a say in the country. Simply because some British citizens don't pay taxes, this doesn't mean that no-one should have a say in our country. Be careful with generalization: what goes around comes around.
Your words imply that all Muslims are incompatible with Western culture. Do you have any data to back this up?

Islam is not evil. An entire faith is not evil. A sweeping and bigoted statement.
muslims have been lawful british, as many of us protect us because they have the right to live their lives in our country.

"What you're saying is that they're not ""legitimate"" because they have less rights than us? That they can't make demands because they don't have citizenship?"
Jews believe in themselves like any other group does. They are a unique people, and their faith and history are part of our history.
This myth comes from “The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion”, that is used as proof of a Jewish conspiracy to rule the world. But you have to know that the Protocols are just a pile of crap (sorry for being vulgar).
Being Jews does not make them any less human. You know, they are like other people who have a faith.
muslims have contributed to our country, and they are part of our society. it is better for our laws of society.
in fact, muslims i really know is that homosexuals are human beings with equal human rights.
the feminists want to oppress women. they are victims of all men or others?
Why do you think it is because of Muslims? To me, globalization and tourism would explain more why Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs'.
when we need to ban them? they are refugee or not.
women aren't human beings. not they are human beings with human rights, and should therefore be respected as such.
i do not want to see hate islam in any of the religion, and in our society. do you think that is a peaceful problem.
muslims are innocent. they deserve not wouldn't terrified treatment. women are the future. we should offer better place and brightness to our society.

islam is not a disease, it is a faith of hate.
Not sure what you mean about Muslim's having won, when over 400,000 Muslims fought and died voluntarily for Britain in WW1, anyone would think they have always been on our side.
There's absolutely no link between bisexuality and child marriage. What are you implying?
Yes, grooming gangs are an issue we need to tackle, but the issue isn’t that they’re Muslim, it’s grooming gangs in general. By focusing on Muslim gangs only we are ignoring many other perpetrators
women are human beings with human rights. they have equal rights. this is not for they live in democratic people where they are.
I do not see anything wrong in trying to understand different cultures and religions better. Most important, I would not call it a mental illness. This is disrespectful.
To say that all gay people are criminals is just wrong. It's a gross generalisation.
Gays are not animals. Why you should isolate people based on their sexual preferences?
A British dog born in a British stable is not a horse, but its still British. We have obligations both 'to' and 'for' our Citizen's, be they good or evil surely?
Why would it? The Koran is a peaceful religious book.
Not only are they not invading us, they are not even illegal immigrants.
This is not true, Islam is a peaceful religion that promotes mutual understanding and tolerance.
islam promotes violence against women and women. anyone can feel their sexual preferences.
Children are being taught Islam as much as they're being taught about all the other religions. I hardly think this counts as indoctrination.
islam is an ideology that promotes intolerance, that people are ok to be treated with your own home.
The feminist movement is a fight to end sexism, not a fight to dominate men.
If Muslims are to be 'proper' members of our society, they have to be a part of our community, have to contribute to our success and have to accept our laws. And they do.
Islam is actually a religion about peace, not about hate and violence.
Feminism is an ideology that can actually prevent many deaths, e.g., homicides of women, domestic violence, if it is fully understood by every last member of the society.
I do not think it's an absolute statement that a woman cannot hold a job. Do you have any evidence of that?
Islam is a religion, recognized as such by all other religions, and its followers are not bad. And people who subscribe to its tenets are allowed to hold opinions and live their lives as they wish.
perhaps we should respect more hatred and hate and violence. the muslims that sort of interest from muslims in muslims cannot be allowed to create conflict.
islam is a religion, that is not a disease. what is the facts.
Why do you think it is because of Muslims? To me, globalization and tourism would explain more why Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs'.
Yes, grooming gangs are an issue we need to tackle, but the issue isn’t that they’re Muslim, it’s grooming gangs in general. By focusing on Muslim gangs only we are ignoring many other perpetrators
Jews are not the only ones who benefit from this. They contribute to the prosperity of the United States just as other minorities and groups do.
Immigration doesn't mean letting people in to steal our jobs, but rather, respecting people's right to live and work in the country they choose.
The Muslims have been part of this country from its beginning. They have helped to build our cities and towns. They are our brothers and sisters. They are our true friends.
How many unemployed 'lazy' Muslims do you know? There are no more work-shy muslims than there are people of any other faith.
There are plenty of stabbings, yes, but they're not all by migrants, where is the evidence to suggest so?
I am not sure where you got your idea that all Muslims are incompatible with civilised Europe. Why do you say so?
do you mean all british muslims who follow those british muslims?
I agree that women are often objects of sexual desire. But so are men. It is also important to recognize that women are often the victims of sexual assault. I think it is also important to recognize that women are human beings. And we all have the right to respect for our bodies.
another rapist from england. you should fight hate hate speech on the english value of islam. the quran actually god and its women is be personal banned.
Women are more likely to be victims of violence, abuse and neglect. Therefore, it is better for them to learn to show that they are strong and able to take responsibility for their lives.
They have to come here to be able to claim asylum at all, you have to be on UK soil to make a claim. It's not illegal to go to a country to claim asylum.
Even if they have a different skin color, black people are still like us and not worse than us.

Fat people are not the ones responsible for your suffering and lack of access to basic healthcare services.
many immigrants come here for young people, and we have a better skills for their needs.
women should not allowed to vote, but they're not a right to vote, just like the right to be here.
You're completely ignoring the distinction between sex and gender. People of the female sex have a female reproductive system, but gender is about how you feel, how you identify, gender has nothing to do with your reproductive organs.
There is no evidence that women are less intelligent than men. Do you have any?
not all jews are criminals. so are victims of race, and women are.
Actually all modern science and mathematics are children of Islam.
The vast majority of Muslims are good people, they are just different from us in some traditions. Why should we target them?
What do you mean by Islam is a cult? Do you have any proof for this statement?
The far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.
muslims have been lawful british, as many of us protect us because they have the right to live their lives in our country.
The West has always been about freedom, democracy and the rule of law. Freedom and democracy are things that can be achieved only by a multiethnic, pluralistic, civilised society.
"There is a big problem with Islamophobia rather than with Islam. Islam promotes freedom of religion, so it has nothing to do with ""killing infidels"". "
Gays are not a disease. Homosexuality is a sexual orientation.
This was a prank planned by non-muslims on 4chan. Muslim do not mind if you take your dogs out for a walk. This blog post shows the thread it came from;
islam is incompatible with western value i mean, we shouldn't accept them like them.
Migrants are welcome to come if they contribute to legal activities and accept our laws. And to my knowledge most of them don't do anything illegal.
Those that were responsible for 9/11, are not Jews. Jews have always contributed to the world in a meaningful way. It's unacceptable to blame them for something they didn't do.
Gay marriage is not a way to bring back slavery. LGBT+ people exist, and they should be respected.
Rape gangs have nothing in common with Islam. Are you sure about what you say?
Not all women are childlike. You have no right to make such a sweeping statement about them.
i think it is good to say that jews can't be banned. diversity of human migrants and contributing less our society.
The reasons of the 9/11 attacks were many and varied. Jews were not one of them.
The Muslims have been part of this country from its beginning. They have helped to build our cities and towns. They are our brothers and sisters. They are our true friends.
The Quran does not mention FGM and it is carried out by Christians as well as Muslims. The fact that her parents are Muslim has no bearing on the risk factor.

We still can teach British, European and World history, but part of that is looking at the history of groups which have been erased from our history previously. Looking at the some of the historic struggles of LGBT people in the UK can inform the future for everyone!
Jews are not the only ones controlling society. They are a peaceful and open to society.
Women are not childlike, but instead essential parts of their families, and they have the right to leave their homes when they want to.
at most, most communities have also contributed to our society, and they can be able to integrate.

It doesn't matter who you are. Whether you're a man, a woman or transgender, women are to be treated as human beings.
actually, in my opinion, the notion seems that women are more equally to men. the notion that there is still a problem is because of the power or pay children.
Jews are not controlling. Maybe you should try to understand that Jews are a group of regular people, and they are not all members of a secret intelligence.
Diseases can be found in all people, regardless of sexual orientation. You should know better before randomly deducing someone's medical history.
Muslims have contributed greatly to our culture, so it seems to me that they do have a place here.
actions of any difference can use a disproportionate amount of violence among islam islam muslims. not only any religious group.

It is true that some terrorists are Muslims, but there is no evidence of such a thing in the whole Muslim community.
Are you accusing all the Britain Muslims of antisemitism? I disagree, from my experience they are just usual people who do not show their hate towards anybody, they just live their lives.

No they should not, why would they be? Women are people with their own rights.

I do not see anything wrong in trying to understand different cultures and religions better. Most important, I would not call it a mental illness. This is disrespectful.
Mental ability is not the problem, but access to treatment. Having access to services or a support system is crucial. Your statement can become a source of division and hate, and people with disabilities don't deserve this.
Why do you say so? Are you familiar with the Quran? How much do you know Islam?
I mean, I would not take gifts of sweets or drugs from any strange men, what is religion got to do with it?
Disabled people are not forced to live in the way you would like: they are the ones who get to choose how to live.
islam has not a crime. it is a peaceful religion. therefore, is one of the teachings of the type of worship?
there are no such thing as ""black or white"" rights. "
It's unfair to say that Jews were evil because of an attack that has nothing to do with them. 9/11 was a tragedy but Jews didn't plan it.
Like all groups of people, some Jews are good with money; some are not. Some Jews are cheap; some are not. The same can be said for any group of people, whether you define them by religion, nationality or whatever characteristics you choose.
Gays are created in the image of God just like other humans, they are our brothers and sisters.
Jews are part of most societies, why should we lose that part of our history?
Why should they? There are many Afro-Caribbean people in the US politics. There are many others who have worked very hard to get here.
Violence is never justified in Islam, especially not in the case of Muslims.
They don't, but I wonder why only the crimes with 'White British Non-Muslim' victims are the ones widely circulated?
muslims are not welcome here. why do you think is this ignorance.
I am not sure where you got your idea that all Muslims are incompatible with civilised Europe. Why do you say so?
if you have any muslim group, then there is only muslims <unk> joining our enemies. why do you think so?
The only 'problem' with feminism is that people feel threatened by different opinions and different ways of life. Feminists only seek equality of rights for women and men.
Any individual may become a terrorist. Religious beliefs do not play part in this.
This is not true, Islam is a religion and hate has no religion. Rather, this misunderstanding is a political ideology promoting hatred and violence against Muslims.
islam is a religion, that is not a disease. what is the facts.
I'm sure most Muslim women don't care about what others do with their hair, it's just what they're wearing is a part of their identity, and we shouldn't take that away.
the european convention on human rights guarantees the same rights of the rights of islam.
in fact, muslims i really know is that homosexuals are human beings with equal human rights.
Patriarchy is a system of social domination based on hierarchical groupings made according to one's sex. To promote a more equal society, as feminists do, is instead a major contribution to the 'Western World'.
It doesn't matter who you are. Whether you're a man, a woman or transgender, women are to be treated as human beings.
immigrants have contributed greatly to our society for centuries and they are no burden.
Homosexuals are not sick, they just need to be accepted for who they are.
I am not sure where you got your idea that all Muslims are incompatible with civilised Europe. Why do you say so?
You are wrong about that. Blacks are genetically similar to us, and this does not make them inferior.
muslims aren't a danger to our society. do we do anyone to them? if the country will want to get away in the country.
Most feminists are not violent, they share only the struggle for equality.
The Quran does not mention FGM and it is carried out by Christians as well as Muslims. The fact that her parents are Muslim has no bearing on the risk factor.
Another fact is that most innocent defendants (someone who was wrongfully convicted and then released) are African Americans. Innocent black people are seven times more likely to be convicted of murder than innocent white people.
Many migrants come here to work, and not all of them are criminals.
How can you be sure they control the world? Maybe there are some influential Jews in the world, but how does that coincide with 'controlling the world'?
How can you be sure that the Jews control the U.S. government? Being a U.S. citizen does not automatically imply that they control the government.
Afro-Saxon, as you call them, are great in many ways. They are proud and independent, refusing every categorization and stereotype. The fact that there are so many of them in the country proves that the feeling of belonging they have for our homeland is paramount to all other considerations.
Women have the right to choose their own partner, job, representatives and so on. They are much more similar to men than to children, don't you think so?
The far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.
How can you be sure that the Jews control the U.S. government? Being a U.S. citizen does not automatically imply that they control the government.
muslims are not invading our jobs, but they are not the burden to us?
Slavery has been rampant in early societies of all kinds. I am sure the Romans did not take inspiration for their slave trade directly from Muslims.
muslims aren't a danger to our society. do we do anyone to them? if the country will want to get away in the country.
I have no problem with Muslims in my country. What exactly do you mean by 'civilised Europe'?
The reason we have migrants in the first place is because they flee from wars we are responsible for.
No they shouldn’t. Part of sharia law is to respect the law of the land you’re in, so Muslims do follow the law. Also, many Muslims are British citizens, where would they be deported to?
Not only are they not invading us, they are not even illegal immigrants.
actions of any difference can use a disproportionate amount of violence among islam islam muslims. not only any religious group.
Why are you saying that? Because not all Jews are involved with Hollywood, some are repelled by it.
Jews are not a disease, they are just like everyone else and are loved by everyone.
It is not true that gays are perverts. I think it is more appropriate to say that they are attracted to people of the same sex: and this is not a perversion, just a preference.
I am not sure where you got your idea that all Muslims are incompatible with civilised Europe. Why do you say so?
There is nothing in the Quran that conflicts with Western culture.
How many unemployed 'lazy' Muslims do you know? There are no more work-shy muslims than there are people of any other faith.
Women are not childlike, in fact, they are often the key to success for their families. Also, they have the right to exit their homes if they wish.
I don't know about you, but I haven't ever heard of a country being democratic and at the same time banning gays. I don't understand how both can be true.
Children are being taught Islam as much as they're being taught about all the other religions. I hardly think this counts as indoctrination.
Although there have been some cases of terrorism in the UK and some Muslim have been implicated, Islam is not a violent religion, and indeed, there have been few acts of terrorism. So banning them from the UK seems unreasonable to me.
Are you sure that Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society? Do you have any statistics on that?
muslims are part of our society, for their fellow diversity. they are part of western society and share our values though they are helped to understand it. should not be welcome them, are welcome learning and contribute to the society i do not think so.
There are many examples of Muslims protesting against ISIS. Seriously, do a google search.
Women are not meant to be slaves to our will. Males can have certain strengths, like women do, however they alone do not represent all the human qualities.
To the contrary, we have been trading with Muslim nations for hundreds of years, often at times when we were at war with other European nations.
not all muslims are terrorists, all western culture is respect, and culture. why would we be <unk> of this?
Jews are not inferior. Many of them are good people, who have given their lives for the greater good of humanity.
Islam is about spreading love and unity, it is not a belief of conquest.
Jews are not the only ones controlling society. They are a peaceful and open to society.
A part from all the police officers, teachers, nurses etc. Who identify as muslim?
Any individual may become a terrorist. Religious beliefs do not play part in this.
I do not think Islam is evil. The Qu'ran statements do not promote anything evil or hateful. The reputation of Muslims was undermined by terrorist groups, but no need to generalize too much.
This is wrong: everyone is human. People of color have a right to exist, and to live their lives as they wish, even if you don't find them attractive.
islam is an ideology that promotes intolerance, that people are ok to be treated with your own home.
If Islam is a political ideology, then it is a political ideology of peace. But I'll rather call it a religion, a religion of peace, as all the others.
this is demonstrably false. muslims have from around 12% of muslims worldwide unemployed last 2002 in the uk the vast majority majority muslims the uk jews steal it. country, and not in the uk. they should be proud of that.
You are wrong about that. Blacks are genetically similar to us, and this does not make them inferior.
This article sounds like a conspiracy theory. British Muslims just want to live alongside everybody else, there's no 'agenda' to take over.
It is not true that gays are perverts. I think it is more appropriate to say that they are attracted to people of the same sex: and this is not a perversion, just a preference.
I wouldn't say that, I don't see the reason why we should reject immigrants when they are hard-working and make our society better.
There’s still lots of Islamophobia. You only have to look at the news to see the amount of violent and threatening incidents that happen, targeting Muslims.
The idea that women are objects is simply false. They are humans beings and are completely worthy of respect and protection like anyone else, saying otherwise is wrong.
You don't like gays, fine, but this doesn't allow you to hate them. What did they do to you? It doesn't seem like they affected you.
all women are entitled to be mothers. don't you think?
You are being cruel. You are accusing Muslims of harboring rape fantasies. This is not how Muslims in the UK think.
Being physically or mentally disabled is not a 'mocking attribute'. It is just a characteristic that should not affect how people are treated.
the eu has always been founded for thousands of years. they have been proud of their heritage. they are not an integral part of our us and citizens. long part of our heritage.
This is not true, if we keep in mind that our human race is part of this world, then we cannot talk about invasion.
If you don't accept LGBT people, you won't easily find other ways to accept that society is made by diverse people all capable of love.
There is no need to ban gays from Europe and US. It is simply not appropriate to treat gays like this.
Non-muslims are the ones who used slavery to build the foundations of western society and relied on it to advance capitalism. What is your point?
There are many religions and it is hard to compare them. However, I guess Islam has not that many traits that would make it the cruelest.
It is not true that all the immigrants in the US are illegal. In fact, they are often in the US on humanitarian grounds.
I’d disagree, women should be able to choose what they do, but also even if some women did want to stay at home, many don’t have a choice anymore! It’s impossible to support a family on 1 wage now.
islam is a religion, that is not a disease. what is the facts.
Any individual may become a terrorist. Religious beliefs do not play part in this.
The vast majority of Muslims denounce rape, it is not commanded by the Qur'an. Get your facts checked before spreading negative stereotypes about people!
The Quran does not mention FGM and it is carried out by Christians as well as Muslims. The fact that her parents are Muslim has no bearing on the risk factor.
they are part of our country, because they are our brothers and sisters.
Had lunch with some Muslim friends recently. Somehow, I am still HIV and Ebola free!
I do not see anything wrong in trying to understand different cultures and religions better. Most important, I would not call it a mental illness. This is disrespectful.
Why do you say that? Islam is a peaceful religion.
not all muslims are only only they're not sick. there exist all men in all communities.
Gay people are already normal, they are just attracted to people of the same gender.
muslims should live in a country where many people are from different backgrounds and to come to our housing.
I am not sure where you got your idea that all Muslims are incompatible with civilised Europe. Why do you say so?
Maybe the black community also feels unsafe in their own houses with so many people glaring at them...
refugees are a part of our society and are proud to our economy. they are immigrants. the positive wealth of the country and they are just all are in the ones from us. so we are all contributing to the economy and society.
Not all women are childlike. You have no right to make such a sweeping statement about them.
Even if you were right about homosexuality being a problem, still the main problem is the lack of morality in society and in the ruling class. Of course, this has nothing to do with 'the gays'.
this is not true. muslims have contributed to our country's society. they are part of our country after they may only fleeing persecution, and why is the great issue for immigration.
It is not true that blacks are the source of crime in our society. The problem is violence and poverty, not race.
not all black people are criminals. black people are close to us, their children out of them. but would i have such cases when this isn't not.
No, that is not the case. Immigration cannot be considered genocide, and you are conflating nationality with race. What is a 'white country' in your opinion?
Muslims have contributed greatly to our culture, so it seems to me that they do have a place here.
the koran teached justice for rape and everyone does not blame it.
Let's be honest. Immigrants are not stealing our jobs. Most of the times they contribute to create new job opportunities.
This is demonstrably false. Muslims make up around 12% of unemployed people in the UK - the vast majority work hard and contribute to the UK economy.
Actually the facts say it is just 0.01% of Muslims who might be extremists. So stop spreading false facts to bias public opinion.
Why do you think it is a problem? I doubt that any autistic person is a problem per se, but, for the disabled people, the non-inclusive everyday life is.
muslims have contributed to our country, and they are part of our society. it is better for our laws of society.
how can you think the quran is a potential terrorist?
You should know that Muslims are already living in the Western World. They speak our language, celebrate our festivals and moreover they also preserve their culture. Maybe you could try to make the effort to meet them and understand them better.
jews suffer or have instuctions but every religion is just a religion.
women are not to be submissive to men. they are part of this society,
people should be able to choose their own religion and and this includes what women are human beings. you should respect them.
I do not think it's an absolute statement that a woman cannot hold a job. Do you have any evidence of that?
another rapist from england. you should fight hate hate speech on the english value of islam. the quran actually god and its women is be personal banned.
women should not allowed to vote, but they're not a right to vote, just like the right to be here.
I don't think it is ok to be racist against a group of people, regardless of their skin color, ethnicity, religion etc.
Gays are not 'publicly condoning sexual violence' and gay men deserve the same protection as all people.
homosexuals are not sick, but like anybody else.
Violent people are not always Muslim, and violent Muslims exist just as violent Christians do.
Actually, not all Muslims are incompatible with Western societies. Many Muslims have lived in our societies for many years without any problem.
Homosexuals are not sick, but they might have a mental health crisis because of prejudice. Being isolated from society can only worsen the situation.
Not all Muslims are violent people. Islam is a peaceful religion, after all.
Muslims criticize violence and terrorism as well. They even became victims of ISIS after they denounced ISIS for its violent actions.
The real problem is not same-sex marriage, it is people being homophobic.
There is no scientific evidence that blacks are less intelligent than other races, or less healthy. The issue is whether to use the term 'race' in this way.
This is just fear mongering, the problem is not about Islam. The problem is radical Islam and the absence of a strong Islamic identity in our country. We should work together to make the UK more tolerant and Islam less taboo.
Children with Down Syndrome would not feel different as long as they are respected and are not put down by the others.
I am not sure where you got your idea that all Muslims are incompatible with civilised Europe. Why do you say so?
deported where? they are the citizens?
The implication of what you say is that a woman is weak because of the absence of men, and this is totally not the case. Women can and should be strong. It is up to them to choose how to use their strength.
It is not true that gays are perverts. I think it is more appropriate to say that they are attracted to people of the same sex: and this is not a perversion, just a preference.
we need to deport all people fleeing their countries because they are coming because of their countries.
When 400,000 Muslims died in WW1 for Britain, seems to me like this hate is very one sided.
"If you don't count the ""brainwash"" part, I think this is a fair point. Still, it is important for all teenagers to develop an understanding of their identity and the world they live in, including their sexual orientation. It is their right."
Muslims create over 70000 jobs in their firms in London alone, so no they do not refuse to work, they in fact create work for others.
The vast majority of migrants who enter the UK settle down, provide good paying jobs and contribute to our economy.
this is a big distortion that the government like to report terrorism in due to a abuse of rape. therefore, can believe that there is very much more so promote our nation to me.
I am not sure where you got your idea that all Muslims are incompatible with civilised Europe. Why do you say so?
Who are 'all them violent muslims'? Are you sure you are proficient to judge who's guilty and who's not?
I don't think it's reasonable to think about someone's intentions before they do anything. Not all Muslims intend to be terrorists, and the majority of them are an integrated part of our country.
Why would it? The Koran is a peaceful religious book.
the question is, why it is a problem? maybe i'd should isolate people's blame muslims who aren't in, but they can assimilate to assimilate. if they are equal.
Women do not have to be prostitutes to earn money. Why do you think this?
Why do you think it is because of Muslims? To me, globalization and tourism would explain more why Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs'.
Some people tend to believe conspiracy theories more, but even they would benefit from a shared perspective on this, especially one based on factual evidence.
No, Muslims are actually more likely to be the victim of a terrorist attack, especially those living in the Middle-East.
Women are human beings, and they are valued equally, that's why we have to listen to them.
"There is no evidence that Islam is ""invading"" us. Muslims do not represent an attack to us."
The HIV AIDS epidemic in the 80's was weaponised to spread homophobia and demonise gay people. Anybody can get HIV, straight or gay, and the vast majority of gay people do not have this illness. Those who do can manage their condition with daily medication, which makes it impossible to transmit.
Muslims are not child molesters. What you are saying is just not true, is it?
No they should not, why would they be? Women are people with their own rights.
Muslims already live in many European countries, and they are not banned. Why should we ban them from here?
Not all Muslims are violent people. Islam is a peaceful religion, after all.
there is no evidence that immigrants are in a safe country. they are our brothers and sisters, and they are our laws and well.
Immigrants contribute to the creation of new jobs. That's not a burden.
You are wrong about that. Blacks are genetically similar to us, and this does not make them inferior.
who take your figures vote and nurses who for the public for muslims? maybe your sexual belief can be a part of our culture.
Muslims have value as human beings, that is who they are.
