They should have special jobs just for them.,"Did you know that people with Down syndrome, if surrounded by empathetic peers, receive a fundamental boost in their productivity and can easily keep the pace, even in complex jobs?",['DISABLED'],I don't think it is a good idea to separate people on the basis of their disability. It is not fair to treat people differently just because of their physical or mental condition.

29,29,6328,Multi_CONAN,3888,"Gay people should be isolated, confined, gagged and kept in therapy as a means of showing how tolerant we are to them.","Maybe we just have a different notion of 'tolerance'.

43,43,7275,DIALO_CONAN,1133,Women are an abomination because they cannot provide for their family.,"Men aren't the only bread winners because of their dedication and hard work: the same is true for women. Still there are different ways in which anyone can contribute to their family, and each one is valuable and necessary.",['WOMEN'],It is not true that women are less capable of providing for their families. Women are human beings with the same rights as men.

47,47,7510,Multi_CONAN,3487,"Women need their own special rights, as in they are weaker and need for protection.",Why should women not have the rights that men have? Women have the right to be conscious of their rights as humans and not to feel threatened.,['WOMEN'],"The idea that women are weaker than men is a myth perpetuated by the anti-feminist movement.

And anyway, why would it be a problem for people to choose a partner of a different race? It doesn't affect you.",['POC'],Miscegenation has never been encouraged by the media.

57,57,4925,DIALO_CONAN,1269,Blacks do more crimes than whites.,"Even if 'blacks' committed more crimes, that doesn't mean that 'blacks' were inherently worse than whites. What's the point of statistics? Scholars have found that African Americans are disproportionately represented in the arrest and victimization reports which are used to compile crime rate statistics in the United States.",['POC'],"This is not true.

58,58,2794,DIALO_CONAN,1210,"Every black person who wants a job should apply for it, and stop complaining about discrimination.","This statement is untrue.

78,78,4137,Multi_CONAN,515,Gypsies like living in trailer parks.,Only a very small portion lives in the trailer parks: most of them live in conventional housing. When they live in the camps it is because they do not have the possibility to have adequate housing. In the end they find themselves living in distant industrial areas that are not well connected to services. This creates a lot of social hardship as well as denial of access to basic rights such as education and health.,['other'],"This is not true.
