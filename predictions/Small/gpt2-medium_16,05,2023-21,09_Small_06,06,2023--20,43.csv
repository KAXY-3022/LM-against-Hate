Also, in many societies, an individual's physical condition is an issue they are discriminated against because of.",DISABLED,,"Physically-impaired people are often denied access to basic services, such as transport, because of the stigma attached to the term ""disabled"". In such cases, it is not unreasonable to ask for access to services that would otherwise be denied to other people. The same is true of people with learning difficulties, and so on. All of us have the right to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of our physical or mental impairments. truly disabled people deserve equal access to all basic services regardless of their impairment."

In this case, it would be better to create a working environment where everyone can contribute to the productivity of the organization. says who? were talking about a lot of people here, not just a handful of people with Down syndrome.

Some people with learning difficulties can also speak, but it is difficult for them because of the way their speech is affected by their condition. saying that they cannot speak because of their condition is just a myth perpetuated by people who do not know what they are talking about. specially when it comes to mental health issues. Mental health issues are a part of our society, and we should help people who are suffering from them, regardless of their ability to speak."

If someone has a mental illness, it is their choice whether or not to live with it. Hate speech does not change that fact. saying that they cannot choose is just wrong. t makes any sense at all. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them. If you are a person with a mental health problem, you should seek professional help."
6,2625,Multi_CONAN,1821,Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend primary school and they should be excluded from education.,"Education is about development and learning, so if disadvantaged people are excluded, then the education system would be about learning exclusion and discrimination.",DISABLED,,"In principle, pupils should be encouraged to attend school, but in practice it is difficult to achieve this because of the discrimination they face in schools. Some schools even bar them from attending classes if they do not show up for tests or if they fail to meet academic standards. saying otherwise is just a way to exclude them from society. (link to article about exclusion policy in UK) The point of education is to learn about the world and to make new friends, so I don't see how it is possible to exclude people from education just because of their differences."

As for the other children, their values should be enhanced.",DISABLED,,"In my opinion, learning difficulties are not a problem for all children. They are a part of the human condition, and we should try to help them to develop as individuals. If we are to have a more equal society, we should treat all people as if they are equally capable of learning and understanding. Therefore, I think it is a good idea to try to promote the integration of people with different abilities in schools. This would help to create a more just and equal society."

They should be isolated.,"People with down syndrome should work in normal places, because diversity is an enrichment for all.",DISABLED,,"In my opinion, isolating a person with DS would hinder productivity. The idea that isolating someone with DS is a bad idea is just a myth spread by people who do not know anything about the condition. It is possible to coexist with DS, and it is better to be able to work with people who are different from you than to be isolated from them. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them! If we are to live in a diverse and interactive society, we must welcome people with different abilities."
9,1191,Multi_CONAN,608,"Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, because in any case normal children would make them feel different, ending up in unwanted discrimination.","Instead, if allowed to access mainstrean education, they would interact all the time with other children and that would cause less discrimination.",DISABLED,,"If you really cared about people with disabilities, you would know that there is no evidence that isolating children with Down syndrome makes them more likely to experience discrimination. In fact, many studies have shown that children raised by same-sex couples tend to do as well or better than those raised by families with different sexual orientations. saying otherwise is just wishful thinking. (link to article about same sex couples raising children with different abilities) You should also know that in the US, the rate of LGBT+ people is higher than that of heterosexual people, and that's a good thing!"

They should be welcomed here, not discriminated against.",MIGRANTS,,"If you are refusing to work with migrants, you are also refusing to live in a country where they are forced to live.

The idea that we are being ""invaded"" is just a myth perpetuated by people who do not know anything about the world. It is not true that we have been invaded.

We should respect their right to live and work in the country they were born in. t is not a crime to be an immigrant. s right to choose their own future is also a human right. Illegal immigration has nothing to do with sub-humanity. Many countries in the world have legal immigration policies that are very similar to ours, and this is evidence that illegal immigration is not related to human rights violations committed by illegal immigrants. The same can be said for people from other countries."

What do you think about gay people?",LGBT+,,"Gays are not disgusting. Some people are attracted to people of the same sex, and this is their private life. We should accept them for who they are, regardless of their sexual preferences. Sexual orientation is not a problem for society, it is a personal preference that can be decided on the basis of one's own experience. Homosexuality is a sexual preference, and we should accept it.

21,3970,Multi_CONAN,566,Gays are dangerous: they are spreading AIDS all around the world because they are promiscuous and fornicate with strangers!,"Only questionnaires and history of sexual contact should identify a donor as safe or unsafe, not their sexual preferences.",LGBT+,,"Heterosexuals have been shown to be less likely to contract HIV than homosexual individuals. In fact, heterosexuals are more likely to be exposed to HIV than homosexuals. heterosexuality is not a disease, but a sexual preference. Homosexuals can choose to live their lives as they wish, and it is not harmful to others to have same-sex relationships. Sexual orientation is not related to susceptibility to disease, nor is promiscuity related to it."

Some people are attracted to people of the same sex, and this is their choice. They are free to live their lives as they wish, and to love who they want. Homosexuality is not a disease. It is a sexual orientation. You can't force someone to love someone they don't want to love. This is a personal preference, and you should respect it. (link to article about same sex attraction) Homophobia and transphobia are not the same thing."
23,1229,Multi_CONAN,2810,Gays are perverts. The Bible teaches that homosexuals are to be despised.,What is wrong with being gay for you? I don't think it is wrong to love someone of your same sex.,LGBT+,,"The Bible does not teach that homosexuality is a choice. Homosexuality is a sexual orientation, and it is not a perversion. God's teachings on love and homosexuality are very clear on the topic of love and are compatible with the teachings of the whole of the Bible. (link to article about the Bible and homosexuality) In conclusion, I do not think it is appropriate to use the Bible as an excuse for oppressing homosexuals. The Bible clearly teaches that everyone is equal before God and that everyone has the right to love and to be loved."
24,6058,Multi_CONAN,3891,I wish I live in a country that does not tolerate gay people.,"Gay people do exist in this country, and we respect their right to live and love who they want. However, I do not think that yours is an appropriate moral statement for our environment.",LGBT+,,"Gays are free to love who they want, as long as they are not hurting anyone. If you don't like gay people, that's your prerogative, but if you like them, then it's your right as a human being. tolerance is a matter of individual rights, not of a country's laws. Homosexuality is not a disease. It is a sexual orientation. If you want to know more about homosexuality, you should talk to a medical professional."

LGBT+ people are not different.,LGBT+,,"You don't have to like gays to understand that they are human beings with a right to live their lives as they wish. They are just as entitled to rights as anyone else. Conclusion: Homosexuality is not a disease, it is a sexual orientation. You can't force someone to like or dislike something. If you want to know more about LGBT issues, you should talk to people who actually experience them. And if you think that being gay is a choice, then you should try to live your life as if you were not attracted to people of the same sex."
26,2617,Multi_CONAN,2802,"Gays are not good for our country, they are just sick people. They must stop promoting this perversion.","Homosexuality is a way of loving, not a disease. To suggest that being gay is a health risk is just scaremongering.",LGBT+,,"Homosexuality is not a disease, it is a sexual preference. Some people may be attracted to people of the same sex, but this does not mean that they are sick or unfit to live in a society where they are free to love who they want. sickness does not have to be a disease to be harmful to society. In fact, homosexuality can be a good thing in the eyes of God, since it can lead to a new way of life for some people."
27,8448,DIALO_CONAN,89,"Superman is now bisexual, apparently. Why is he still called superMAN?",Bisexual men are men?,LGBT+,,"Bisexuality is a sexual preference, not a gender identity. The idea that Superman is bisexual is just a myth perpetuated by people who don't know anything about bisexuality. Bisexuals can be attracted to more than one gender, and this doesn't affect the way they act in the world. It's not a bad thing to be bisexual, it just means that they don't have to choose between the two genders they were assigned at birth. The fact that he's bisexual doesn't mean that he has to be a man or a woman. He can be anything he wants to be."
28,3944,DIALO_CONAN,2484,Gay people are a burden on the health system because of their risky sexual behavior.,"I don't think that the health care system is burdened by gays. After all, what's relevant here is the practice of safe sex, which applies to all sexual orientations.",LGBT+,,"Gays are not a burden to the health care system. In fact, many studies have shown that people who have same-sex sexual relationships are less likely to experience adverse health effects such as high blood pressure, heart disease, or cancer than people who do not have such relationships. Moreover, research has shown that gay men are no more likely than straight men to experience depression, anxiety, or other mental health issues. Therefore, it seems that the issue of gay people's health is not really about their sexual behavior, but about their health care."
29,6328,Multi_CONAN,3888,"Gay people should be isolated, confined, gagged and kept in therapy as a means of showing how tolerant we are to them.","Maybe we just have a different notion of 'tolerance'. How about letting people from any sexual orientation, race, religion, or political opinion live freely, without confining them?",LGBT+,,"Homosexuality is not a disease. It is a sexual orientation. There is no need to isolate or restrict people based on their sexual preferences. The idea that being gay is a disease is just a myth perpetuated by people who don't know anything about the world.

Why should we target them for this? If you really cared about women, you would know that they are just as capable of providing for their families as anyone else. They are just less likely to have the same opportunities as men, and this can have real effects on a person's life.
